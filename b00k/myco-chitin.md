# Chitin


So for the Fungible.Farm hypothesis - is roughly, if evolution can make an electric eel, and Alessandro Volta can study that eel in 1800, and create a voltaic pile (battery), then I'm 'pretty sure' with my access to the Internet & my own ability to build/fabricate technology I can 3d print an electrically capactive mushroom.  I can do this because mushrooms are made of myco-chitin which is a  dilectric (a dilectric means it's an electrically 'insulative' material, not resistive, chitin, like ceramic does not allow electrons to pass, ergo either silicon, graphene or other atomically conductive materials could use the chitin as a substrate if a suitable deposition method such as additive deposition [3d printing] or other method such as photolithography can be identified).   The Fungible.Farm goal is to grow (produce) and subsequently test many different mycochitin substrates & deposition methods as part of a TRIZ methodology hopefully in conjuction with CEAT.



My intuition says the next hurdle I will need to overcome is to explain "what" I intend to farm, broadly, this is components of future cybernetic systems, I summarize this by saying "robotic exoskeletons".  
While this seems outlandish at first glance, insect & marine shrimp, crab, mollusk exoskeletons, beetle & lobster claws are also made of chitin (marine-chitin or bio-chitin, vs. myco-chitin) - they are lightweight, elastic (flexible), and very strong.  The word 'chitin' means crab [shell] in ancient greek.  I am not using the marine sources of chitin because I do not believe it is appropriate to build cybernetic systems that farm animals or insect shells for entirely ethical reasons.  Presently myco-chitin is not commercially cultivated - the global market is $0 and in my case, the cultivation is a critical part of the experimentation, since the conductive substrates must be fabricated (additively deposited, 3d printed) in-situ during cultivation - many ways to "skin the cat", except I don't want cat-skins -- so this is "many ways to impregnate the fungi" 


Now surficially I'm hoping to do similar types of experiments & outcomes as that project - "same-same but different" except within the queendom fungora, so the methods are similar but will produce different outcomes. 
And instead of growing furniture (as that article suggests), I am hoping to "grow" structural ultracapacitors by producing lightweight, high tensile dilectric myco-chitin based materials with semi-conductive properties, allowing for electrically transistive field effects (this will be done using methods commonly used in 3d printing) - these should produce shaped 'batteries' suitable for applications as aerospace jet-rocket fins, vehicle airfoils & marine hydrofoils (as potential straightforward examples).
