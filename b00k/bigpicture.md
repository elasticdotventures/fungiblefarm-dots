# Big Picture


## ðŸŒ± Green Tech
All processes proposed within the Fungible project consume one or more abundant (mostly cellulose) waste inputs, and produce one or more "Fungible" (consumer & or industrial sale-able) outputs during each experiment & operational phases.  

Some of the earliest planning are to inform the organizational tooling related to the "end goals" of the system, which is directly: climate impact, through innovation & disruption of petroleum. 

The plan is to be successful, so the system is designed to handle and operations become easier with more success, which is known as an "anti-fragile" business operating plan.  The first product is the most difficult to build & sell, so the first products are intentionally easy and low-risk (substrates, mushrooms & co2 soap) because they are hard to screw up even with robotics, but they prove & inform the future robotics subsystems.  
## The Executive FAQ

### Can this be simplified?
The core idea(s) of Fungible may seem a bit overwhelming at first glance because it is poly-disciplinary with each mission & goal synergistically supporting eachother.  It is very technologically heavy and it presumes that some research can be reproduced or integrated in ways it has not necessarily been done _yet_.  

The crypographic web3.0 elements seem complicated but offer significantly more flexability and also increase the caliber of talent for any human overhead.  Most of the business documentation will be done in code (including this document, is written in a github version control system). 

The mushrooms are cultivated by robotics (human cultivation is expensive, and a vector for contamination, also humans aren't good at nano-scale & micro-scale precision fabrication).  100% of present-day mycology is hand-driven, and is perhaps the biggest thing to happen to mushrooms & fungi in the last 800 million years, so if we want to cultivate using robotics (someday at micro & nano scale hybrid bio-manufacturing) we need to get those robots done. 

The mushrooms can be grown for food, or to make products with chitin, including novel semi-conductors that are lightweight & high-tensile 'structural energy storage'.  Cybernetics is used to design the systems, and AI is used extensively throughout the business. The Web3 'cyber-governance' business model is a better dojo for AI reinforcement learning.  The 'future' wholesale & retail sales portals will require web3 and the systems are designed for customer visibility.  The nature of 'structural super-capacitors' is perhaps the most ambitious aspect of the project, but the sales portal starts with a simple model of selling "soap" (the kind you wash your hands with), that is mostly environmentally sequestered Co2. 

Few if any of the processes presented here exist "today" or the methods remain on the periphery of 'common knowledge'.  Research is cited where it is available and Fungible.Farm mostly seeks to reproduce research that was not commercialized. 

Fungible.farm includes being 100% to be green-energy powered and have a negative carbon deficit design the Fungi producing Co2 during transpiration & mycogensis. Further, low cost, low emissions PoS (proof of stake) decentralized blockchains and being prepared to quickly scale & stratify production globally if any products become popular enough to warrant such an expansion. 

Fungible.farm uses [TRIZ](TRIZ.md) "Theory of Inventive Problem Solving" using small 'fast-fail' experiments to improve the "luck surface".   Fungible.Farm is intended to operate terrestrially from Australia, but using a US/global anti-fragile business methodology to quickly commercialize biosynthetic research & manufacturing.   

Fungible's TRIZ attempts to sell & commercialize, or give away (for publicity & awareness) research & products during or slightly ahead of the experiment.  

This is a model similar to kick-starter and encourage community participation & awareness of the progression and reward engagement more broadly in STEM including mechatronic agriculture & blockchain. 




_Fungibility_: as a property, of an individual specimen or item, means it is replaceable by another identical item; mutually interchangeable.  In this case methods are designed as black-box functional 'tools' which can be built, interatively tested & refined and perform continous batch or duty-cycle cultivation on Fungi.  Fungible items can be sold. 

This organization also deals with blockchain, smart-contracts, decentralized cyber-governance which is eponymous with both "fungible" coins & "non-fungible" tokens, and plans to launch a brand of SOAP known as "NFTy" mint crypto-coin soap.   The asynchronous chat based cyber-governance protocols are especially well suited for reinforcement learning done within a web3 sales & wholesale/retail experience(s). 

The organizational processes are intended to be super-scalar.
