# *.Fungibles

The broadest goal of the project is to produce multiple methods & mechanisms using fungi to innovatively demonstrate & sell manufacturing prototypes based by combining prior research across many specialized domains. 


When considering the applications, I encourage you to read this publication from MIT related to cultured lab-grown wood:

            * Chitin, Co2 & Graphene green novel material development, sales & licensing


Direct to consumer applications are intially making soap from Co2 and/or meat-replacements from fungi using the mechatronic cultivation to reduce costs.   



The fungal analog to cellulose ligands is chitin, which is the principal material which will be studied for manufacturing by fungible.farm.  Fungible.farm will incorporate cellulose ligands when it is appropriate, we're pro-fungi not anti-cellulose (in fact, fungi chemically consumes cellulose ligands during it's mycellial growth stage). 


Fungible.farm will emphasize concurrent "fast-fail" to develop small but highly reliable+scalable manafacturing prototype methods.  
Each method has one or more commericially viabile outputs to "keep machines running" (such as Co2 SOAP _the cleaning kind_, a consumable consumer surfcant) these 'low tech' manufacturing are used to design/test the robotic systems & software.   mint-scented SOAP called "NFTy" SOAP pragmatically funds & symbollically contributes toward long term Co2 sequestration.  Future examples include create durable wearable electronics & bio-sensors (as examples).  For this reason Fungible.farm is intended to operate as a profit-for-scalability research & development organization, and aspirationally to provide "Spore funding" to other future projects related to trans-humanism & solar-punk biophilic construction & architecture.  Planned as an entirely-robotic manufacturing system and viewing mechatronic planning/simulation & subsequent automata of labor & customer service as fundamental at and early stage in the companies growth to minimize the human 'operations' of the organization. 



It is a call to arms with regard to demonstrate commercial feasibility of various green-tech utopian enabling impact tech:
    * mycology, bio-transitors, structrual super-capacitors
    * synethic indoor vertical agriculture to produce substrates for biopolymers, biofilms and biotransitors
    * a mechatronic farming system planned, and requires a space to:
        * setup & store equipment, secure, weatherproof, sealed at positive air-pressure hepa filtration system
    * 2d single layer deposition in chitin myco-polymers (a dielectic matrial) to create structural super-capacitance, when pricesly deposited in a 2d patterns.
    * "solar-punk" phosphorescent bio-lumenescient lighting co. 
    * the crypto-aspects are mostly for fund-raising, but also security and organizational 
        * positive reinforcement training & enrollment mechanism
        * straight forward "low tech" gamified engagement experience
        * with 'how do i use this' buttons
    mycology, AI parametric geometry as code test & simulation drive design and bio-transistors + crypto-blockchain NFTy coin mint company & network validator with a really spiffy cybersecurity system & web3.0 client & asynchronous cyber-governance portal & tooling.
