# üçÑ Mycology



Approximately 1.5 billion years ago the Queendom Fungora emerged, and enjoyed unchallenged evolutionary domainace for ~300 million years prior to Plantae, eventually dinosaurs, around 50,000 years ago early humans. Despite this very few if any aspect of modern society leverage these capabilities and largely prefer cellulose which lacking the dilectrical capabilities is unsuitable for the proposed application.  Presently petroleum & plastics principally provides the modern analogues that we hope to replace with mechatronic cultivation of fungi & mushrooms as a means to challenge the cellulose renewable economies and provide a furtherer and more disruptive effect to societal dependence on petroleum.  This is structured as a self-funded impact investment (additional investments accelerate the plans, but are not explicitly necessary).  The non-petroleum method is always preferred to test the system on earth before _someday_ _hopefully_ shipping one or more of the systems to Mars to produce materials suitable for a martian biosphere & interplanetary research organization.  For this reason the system is designed from a very 'first-principal' high-utility, extreme-durability, entirely open-source equipment & systems fabrication approach without petroleum, coal (or with petroleum bio-fuel analogs) as an input.
