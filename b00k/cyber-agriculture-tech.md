# Accelerated MycoGenesis

I hope to initially validate my commercial process for cultivating vegetal bio-chitin using accelerated mycogenesis in conjunction with high-voltage induced adaptogenetic responses to process e-waste.   

My control systems themselves are capable of accelerated biogenesis & mycogenesis but I believe there is presently both significantly higher commerciability & opportunity for profitability & sustainability using accelerated mycogenesis for waste remediation.

Once a refined prototype for accelerated mycogenesis is validated.  


This aspect is unproven, whimsical.  I hope to demonstrate that commercially viable bio-chitin cultivation supported by accelerated mycogenesis can be done concurrently with flash graphene production & subsequent deposition into doped bio-ceramics (as a cybernetic system).  I hope to work with AEMO to demonstrate a PoC grid-scale ‘mushroom’ bio-resistors to consume unused-stored battery energy prior to dawn of daily-PV and/or ‘extreme weather’ events to grow bio-solar panels & additional structural batteries in airfoils providing an opportunity where the worse our planetary weather becomes the more energy can also be extracted from the system.  The commercial viability of such a system depends on having access to the high-voltage inductance of the national grid (not consuming energy from it) but to be commercially viable will need to be done in-series with grid transformers rather than be a standalone system (using high voltage as a temporal storage ‘sink’ when it’s useful for the grid operator or step-up facilities to do so)
 
I anticipate each of the systems is commercially viable due to the bioorganic 'green’ from waste inputs and ability to nationally recover minerals. The bio-acceleration is optional, but seems a good use for excess PV energy for post-peak unused renewable energy enroute to hydrolysis or flash-graphene production which can additionally utilize & buy off-peak green-power capacity.
