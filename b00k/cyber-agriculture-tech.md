My ideal role or degree would be in Cybernetic Systems Engineering for terrestrial applications of astrobotany, including mycological remediation of soil & accelerating biogenesis using machine learning/data science.
 
I have attended (audit not-for-credit) online classes and consumed the suggested reading lists for a variety of academic programs including MOOCs from MIT, Stanford, CMU, University of London and many others through courses such as Coursera & Udemy. 
 
Cybernetic systems engineering “CSE” is part of control theory envisioned in the 1940’s but was an unsuitable career during the AI winter of my youth so I followed as an observer.  Cybernetic systems are control systems for biological organisms (not skynet).  As a CSE I can build, program & repair my own scientific instruments to supervise and develop robotic cultivation & manufacturing of biological organisms using a stateful & distributed computing cloud.  
 
I hope to initially validate my commercial process for cultivating vegetal bio-chitin using accelerated mycogenesis in conjunction with high-voltage induced adaptogenetic responses to process e-waste.   My control systems themselves are capable of accelerated biogenesis & mycogenesis but I believe there is presently both significantly higher commerciability & opportunity for profitability & sustainability using accelerated mycogenesis for waste remediation.
 
The resultant vegetal bio-chitin would then be electrochemically processed into doped bio-ceramics for use in lightweight fireproof structural (zero-weight) ultracapacitor ‘batteries’ using an additive manufacturing process with laser fusing of metals such as graphene, phosphorous, or copper deposition would produce bio-transistors for electronics & sensors ideally suitable for robotic exoskeletons or wearable integrated biosynthetic e-textiles. 
 
Once a refined prototype for accelerated mycogenesis is validated (which I can/will do in my garage, soon!) I hope to commence large scale vegetable bio-chitin cultivation & robotic manufacturing, failing that I will likely resort to natural processes that have been operational for the last ~420 million years. I hope to combine the bio-chitin with other constituents such as/including bioengineered enzymes, thin aerogels & variously doped conductive layers, to create a variety of useful biopolymers with embedded transistors (bio-sensors) with materials which are principally obtained from waste outputs such as household waste, electronics, or alternative mining tailings. 
 
My research also suggests that vegetable bio-chitin using additional manufacturing processes could also be useful to fabricate transparent agri-voltaics, biophilic construction materials, and wearable e-textiles (colloquially “conductively doped mushroom leather”).  All of these are imho ‘better than plastics & cellulose’ in nearly every measurable dimension - except commercial availability.

This aspect is unproven, whimsical.  I hope to demonstrate that commercially viable bio-chitin cultivation supported by accelerated mycogenesis can be done concurrently with flash graphene production & subsequent deposition into doped bio-ceramics (as a cybernetic system).  I hope to work with AEMO to demonstrate a PoC grid-scale ‘mushroom’ bio-resistors to consume unused-stored battery energy prior to dawn of daily-PV and/or ‘extreme weather’ events to grow bio-solar panels & additional structural batteries in airfoils providing an opportunity where the worse our planetary weather becomes the more energy can also be extracted from the system.  The commercial viability of such a system depends on having access to the high-voltage inductance of the national grid (not consuming energy from it) but to be commercially viable will need to be done in-series with grid transformers rather than be a standalone system (using high voltage as a temporal storage ‘sink’ when it’s useful for the grid operator or step-up facilities to do so)
 
I anticipate each of the systems is commercially viable due to the bioorganic 'green’ from waste inputs and ability to nationally recover minerals. The bio-acceleration is optional, but seems a good use for excess PV energy for post-peak unused renewable energy enroute to hydrolysis or flash-graphene production which can additionally utilize & buy off-peak green-power capacity. 
 
I hope to repurpose the resulting (captured) CO2 from the mycogenesis to accelerate biogenesis of comestible & medicinal cultivars and demonstrate viability of zero water-loss farming structures to support one or more future colonies anywhere in Australia, globally, or eventually Mars biospheres.  There are many other useful emerging applications for carbon sequestration, in my case hemp cellulose can be used with flash-graphene to create safe & high efficiency solid state batteries so that’s my target output. 

I’m starting with myco-digested e-waste to produce 'space-age' materials - immediately the global demand for bio-chitin lightweight ultracapactive robotic exoskeletons, airfoils & hydrofoils should be immense.   Today the global market for bio-chitin is zero and the marine-chitin global market is < $100m USD globally (made from waste marine arthropod shells using hydrochloric acid).   These are all harmful methods & practices I hope to obviate asap, since they are unsustainable and global demand for marine-chitin would be bad for marine life on a planetary scale and my goal is to “do no harm” with the systems I develop. 
 
The global demand for robotics will likely explode soon, well beyond current industrial applications & home vacuums.  These processes I am proposing will hopefully obsolete Li chemical batteries & exoskeletons due to the structural nature of the shape, zero weight batteries have applications in aerospace, marine, farm and transportation delivery vehicles. 
 
I can only presume that there will be sufficient consumer demand for electric vehicles and robotics with integrated bioorganic exoskeletons, wings & structural batteries ‘at any cost’ due to their strength to weight advantages over materials such as aluminum.  My intuition tells me it is probably possible to create superior materials which are highly cost-competitive within this decade using genetic engineering along with robotic cultivation & processing and so that is what I will attempt to do.
 
Thank you for your time and consideration.
