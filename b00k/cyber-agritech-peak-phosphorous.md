# Peak Phosphorus

* Mushrooms & Fungi do NOT require phosphorous

Mycorrhizal fungi have the ability to solubilize the phosphorus present in fixed form, thus making it available to plants.

Phosphate is needed to replace the phosphorus that plants remove from the soil, and its annual demand is rising nearly twice as fast as the growth of the human population.

Elemental phosphorus exists in two major forms, white phosphorus and red phosphorus, but because it is highly reactive, phosphorus is never found as a free element on Earth. It has a concentration in the Earth's crust of about one gram per kilogram (compare copper at about 0.06 grams). In minerals, phosphorus generally occurs as phosphate.

Phosphates are a component of DNA, RNA, ATP, and phospholipids, complex compounds fundamental to cells.

The reality is the fertilizer component of phosphorus is in short supply and is perhaps 'the next crisis' after climate change is hopefully mitigated the Peak Phosphorus problem will likely emerge (without intravention) between 2030-2040 (at current consumption rates), or by 2100 if steps are taken sooner.   Fungible.farm attempts to address this by creating manufacturing mechanisms for superior-materials which reduce society dependence on both cellulose & petrolems/plastics.  At a minimum Fungible.farm methods may simplifly the exploration and colonization of other planets & moons, including Earths where the lunar regolith is made of KREEP (the P is Phsophorus).
