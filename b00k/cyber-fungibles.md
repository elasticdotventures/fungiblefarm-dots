This uses [TRIZ.md](TRIZ) which is a systems engineering approach where each project informs & makes the next project a little easier, programs, packages & procedures have been chosen for specific roles and most importantly their ability to interoperate & run simulations, perform calculations & conversions using a compositional programmatic fashion. 

In terms of proper data-engineering and I have been investigating tooling in a variety of fields and have some rather technical opinions how some of this new technology can be used.  As a systems engineer with a 30 year career in working with open-source since the very early days when it was still called "Free Software". 

The series of inventions requires building machines, in sort of a sycophantic rube goldberg machine.  Each small invention/contraption is intended so that someday when the organization can adopt newer tools now and will benefit from the ability to access crypto-currency markets natively for any type of significant future-capital needs.  I don't care if it's AI-winter, the research can be performed concurrently.  The focus should be on the early tooling that accelerates choices in terms of technical specifications which are principally done and I am simply sharpening my mental axe on the skills required to perform such an undertaking. 

Conceptually the reader of this document is someday a target customer.  But when it's finished you're interfacing with a polished &amp; significantly more intuitive version. 

* the projects are each saleable proof of concepts designed to grow a project from nothing to something.

* such that it includes a lot of discussion for next-gen organizational tooling because the project will take 1-3 years to finish
* all projects are 1st tier - direct, 2nd tier - indirect climate & human welfare projects in mechatronic design & problem solving

* using AI NLU generative (self assembling with parts & instructions, bill of material) mechatronics design & simulation w/reinforcement learning
    * using dev/ops ci/cd pipeline & automatic asynchronous DAG parallelism
    * tasks will automatically parallelize and can be added using idiomatic functional descriptions, samples, etc. (the system guesses using a co-pilot)
    * onboarding tutorial & crypto-credential/wallet instructions
