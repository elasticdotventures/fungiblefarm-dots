Please send an email to hello@fungible.farm

Plan to contact various types of organizations seeking Letters of Intent for a new startup “Fungible.farm” & Australian BSN to help establish a valuation and credit line, obtain a piece of land and scale out of the garage. 

I’m a new Australian expat with an extensive California Silicon Valley network and my Australian network is quite small. 

I’m optimistically hoping to obtain written expressions of interest or letters of intent for Australian or global investment & manufacturing partners before Q1 2022 to help me finance an Australian micro-farm (100 hectares) R&D scale. 


# Australia

 I’m currently designing documentation for assistance with the Australian government “Future Farms” for investment international collaboration in ag-tech.
