#  Welcome to Fungible.Farm üçÑ+ü§ñ+üï∏Ô∏è=üëã

This is the public fungible.farm documentation & planning repository which is hosted at [http://dots.fungible.farm](http://dots.fungible.farm)

Fungible.Farm is difficult since it covers many topics few people anything about.  There are no analogues or parallels made today. 
The complexity is inherient from aspects of the operating plan necessary to achieve 'waste input, fungible output' with negative-carbon footprint, 
and 'do no harm' only positive environmental & societal impact. 

Most startups don't begin with such arduous constraints or ambitious goals, and most startups will fail anyway.   Fungible.Farm would rather _fail_ than succeed and persist the harmful & wasteful business models, disposable consumerism, climate change, and the best way for us to become successful is to _do something_ to make a positive impact(s) on the future. 

## üõó The Elevator Pitch
 Australian cybernetically grown mushrooms & fungi using AI in a _mostly_ mechatronic _lights-out_ wet-lab for continous-flow electro-chemical fabrication of novel graphene substrates & thin film selectively transistive biopolymers.   Green zero-waste negative-carbon-footprint factory operating principally on waste-inputs & green electricity to produce fungible comestibles (mushrooms - targeted for meat-alternatives) & Co2 sequestered soap in addition to energy-storage high-Youngs modulus structural ulta-capacitors.  All simulated and sold using web3 interfaces & crypto-currency smart-contracts with gender-pronoun-yei organizational decentralized cyber-governance. 

This repository will break down the method(s) within the madness.  ü§ì 

## ü¶ñ Potential Impact Statement

Fungible.farm is leveraging 'neo-modern' tech, and also tapping into roughly 1.5 billion years of "lost" evolutionary learning in queendom fungora, where at least 800 million years was done prior to the arrival of mammals. So we're going to produce novel inventions that will reshape your future tomorrow - just wait!   We live in a cellulose driven renewable economy and Fungible.Farm is going to mycologically remediate this planet (and someday terra-form others) with the technology that will be demonstrated. 

Everything in the business plan is green tech, and comes from a waste input, 100% of the outputs are comestible, green, co2 sequested, life-saving applications. Green tech was chosen not for it's impact but for it's ability to scale to planetary size & inpsire young minds about a solar-punk utopian future.  

Fungible.farm is intentionally engineered to run sustainably at a carbon deficit (negative footprint).  Fungible.farm incorporates several trans-human poly-social impacting many areas where humanity is presently faltering and unsustainable.  Fungible.farm was designed to be built & shipped (_someday_) to build/run/operate a martian biosphere, of course there aren't parallels on earth! 

Certainly such ambitious goals require a bit of engineering and validation.   However because the systems use mostly artificial intelligence once they are online, it won't be moving a the same pace as your traditional companies do!  (our algorithms don't sleep, they don't need vacations or get sick, they work 7/24 - and they validate crypto-currency so when they aren't learning they are earning!) 

Pronouns, everybody is a "they", or we say "yei".  Fungible.Farm operations are lean on humans, heavy on cognitive algorithms.  Commercial applications to create "profit" will be used for more research and growth, driving costs and creating more novel products over the next decade.  The bigger the organization becomes the more 'green impact' this becomes.  

The organization is extremely high-tech &amp; mostly software-driven interface and utilizes a plurality Artificial Intelligence and very few humans.  This is good because humans are dirty animals and vectors for contagion in a 'dark' wet-lab & manufacturing process.  

Cybernetics is a discipline of 'systems engineering'.   When engineering software systems it is a series of choices about which standards & methods to choose before the first line of code is written, the system must work "on paper".  Principal research began on the precursor system in 2016 in the US and was subsequently moved to Australia in 2020 during covid.  Small tests & research has been done to further specific intuition on ambiguous areas. 

The outline(s) below are conceptual project outline, components and systems that are in various stages of being built and will need to interoperate.

The initial focus is fast-prototyping & tooling, & software simulation & delivery systems & products.  Presently looking for a place to create a small-scale 'proof of viability' end-to-end system, that will ultimately inform the bigger version (someday). 

# Summary & Overview: 

The core idea(s) of Fungible may seem a bit overwhelming at first glance because it is poly-disciplinary with each mission & goal synergistically supporting eachother.  It is very technologically heavy and it presumes that some research can be reproduced or integrated in ways it has not necessarily been done _yet_.  

 The mushrooms are cultivated by robotics (human cultivation is expensive, and a vector for contamination, also humans aren't good at  nano-scale & micro-scale precision fabrication).  100% of present-day mycology is hand-driven, and is perhaps the biggest thing to happen to mushrooms & fungi in the last 800 million years. 
 
 The mushrooms can be grown for food, or to make products, including novel semi-conductors that are lightweight & high-tensile 'structural energy storage'.  Cybernetics is used to design the systems, and AI is used extensively throughout the business. The Web3 'cyber-governance' business model is a better dojo for AI reinforcement learning.  The 'future' wholesale & retail sales portals will require web3 and the systems are designed for customer visibility.  The nature of 'structural super-capacitors' is perhaps the most ambitious aspect of the project, but the sales portal starts with a simple model of selling "soap" (the kind you wash your hands with), that is mostly environmentally sequestered Co2. 

Few if any of the processes presented here exist "today" or the methods remain on the periphery of 'common knowledge'.  Research is cited where it is available and Fungible.Farm mostly seeks to reproduce research that was not commercialized. 

Fungible.farm includes being 100% to be green-energy powered and have a negative carbon deficit design the Fungi producing Co2 during transpiration & mycogensis. Further, low cost, low emissions PoS (proof of stake) decentralized blockchains and being prepared to quickly scale & stratify production globally if any products become popular enough to warrant such an expansion. 

Fungible.farm uses [TRIZ](TRIZ.md) "Theory of Inventive Problem Solving" using small 'fast-fail' experiments to improve the "luck surface".   Fungible.Farm is intended to operate terrestrially from Australia, but using a US/global anti-fragile business methodology to quickly commercialize biosynthetic research & manufacturing.   

Fungible's TRIZ attempts to sell & commercialize, or give away (for publicity & awareness) research & products during or slightly ahead of the experiment.  

This is a model similar to kick-starter and encourage community participation & awareness of the progression and reward engagement more broadly in STEM including mechatronic agriculture & blockchain. 




_Fungibility_: as a property, of an individual specimen or item, means it is replaceable by another identical item; mutually interchangeable.  In this case methods are designed as black-box functional 'tools' which can be built, interatively tested & refined and perform continous batch or duty-cycle cultivation on Fungi.  Fungible items can be sold. 

This organization also deals with blockchain, smart-contracts, decentralized cyber-governance which is eponymous with both "fungible" coins & "non-fungible" tokens, and plans to launch a brand of SOAP known as "NFTy" mint crypto-coin soap.   The asynchronous chat based cyber-governance protocols are especially well suited for reinforcement learning done within a web3 sales & wholesale/retail experience(s). 

The organizational processes are intended to be super-scalar.
