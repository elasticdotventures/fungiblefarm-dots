EVERYTHING SHOULD BE MADE AS SIMPLE AS POSSIBLE, BUT NOT SIMPLIER.
ALBERT EINSTEIN

This is the public fungible.farm documentation & planning repository. 
Everything in this document is public and intended for review.  
To explain the project with broad strokes, it's a series of "yak shaving" software interface tasks of tying systems together intentionally to create an effect - the art of "systems engineering".   When engineering software systems it is a series of choices about which standards to choose before the first line of code is written.  When building something with my own capital and time I try to be efficient in how much proficiency I gain in one particular area. 

The outline(s) below are conceptual project outline, components and systems that are in various stages of being built and will need to interoperate.
The initial focus is fast-prototyping & tooling, & software simulation & delivery systems & products. 


# Summary & Overview: 

The core idea(s) of Fungible may seem a bit overwhelming at first glance because it is poly-disciplinary with each mission & goal synergistically supporting the others.

Few if any of the processes presented here exist "today" or remain on the periphery of 'common knowledge'.  
Fungible.farm includes being 100% to be green-energy powered and have a negative carbon deficit design the Fungi producing Co2 during transpiration & mycogensis. Further, low cost, low emissions PoS (proof of stake) decentralized blockchains and being prepared to quickly scale & stratify production globally if any products become popular enough to warrant such an expansion.

        * novel synthetic bio-polymers & bio-films

Development of specialised bio-synthetic Hybrid additive Manufacturing methods & technologies of (mostly) mushrooms & FUNGI in both organic mechatronic cultivation and non-organic electrochemical synthensis/deposition.   Fungible.Farm intentionally begins with "Fungi" and is a 'farm' cultivation system presented as a dark factory & lights-out wet-lab operated entirely by sterile robotics. 

Fungible.farm uses [TRIZ](TRIZ.md) with some tweaks to improve the "luck surface" within the Australian capitalist-economics and uses a US anti-fragile business methodology to quickly commercialize biosynthetic research & manufacturing.   Fungible's TRIZ attempts to sell & commercialize, or give away (for publicity & awareness) research & products during or slightly ahead of the experiment.  This is a model similar to kick-starter and encourage community participation & awareness of the progression and encourage engagement more broadly in STEM including mechatronic agriculture & blockchain. 

_Fungibility_: as a property, of an individual specimen or item, means it is replaceable by another identical item; mutually interchangeable.  In this case methods are designed as black-box functional 'tools' which can be built, interatively tested & refined and perform continous batch or duty-cycle cultivation on Fungi.  However this project also deals with crypto which as become synonmous with both "fungible" & "non-fungible" tokens, so that is organizationally embraced. 

## ðŸŒ± Green Tech
All processes proposed within the Fungible project consume one or more abundant (mostly cellulose) waste inputs, and produce one or more "Fungible" (consumer & or industrial sale-able) outputs during each experiment & operational phases.  


I feel compelled to say that I practice an anti-fragile and TRIZ (pronounced trees: Theory of Inventive Problem Solving) oriented towards by when asked to hit a target or choose a direction for research sometimes there are unexpected synergies between emerging enabling techologies.
