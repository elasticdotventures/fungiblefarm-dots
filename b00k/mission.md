# Mission: Transhuman Social Impact

The business operates intentionally almost entirely on bio-waste inputs, and seeks to provide many benefits including co2 sequestration.

* some of the projects are non-obvious discoveries or 'required inventions' where the product or tool it is intended to make is a waste product of another process
* ultimately all the waste is green-tech, green-energy net-negative co2 capture & long term storage

# Environment Impact
* co2 sequestration
* petroleum destabilization

# Social Impact
* food
* materials


# Technology Impact
* Cybersecurity & Cyber-governance

The ambitions of the project start small and get bigger in terms of proving & refining tooling early on smaller & less expensive projects that are each *intended* (by design) to profitable & self-sustainable - but are really exercises to testing and improve the underlying systems as more layers of complexity are added progressively. 


I see profitability as a requisite for sustainability & scale.  The vision for the FF & GPB system(s) is a ‚Äúconservatory‚Äù indoor garden or patio farming-appliance that contains cybernetically controlled plants and weather.  The future of residential homes and commercial structures will likely contain multiple biophilic elements that exploit humans' innate desire to be part of a larger biological ‚Äònatural‚Äô ecosystem. These systems also clean the air, and can produce comestible food or medicinal plants such as Cannabis.  The GPB & FF systems operate on terra-firma; however the 2030 & beyond plan is to offer highly-reliable proven ‚Äòastrobotany‚Äô ‚ÄúSpace Farming‚Äù to support the future independent Mars colonies.  Terrestrially the architectural vernacular is colloquially known as ‚Äúsolarpunk‚Äù which is my opinion on how humanity ought to emphasize creating a ‚Äòsustainable‚Äô utopian future here before we colonize other planets. 

I am keen on continuing this pursuit as it has yielded a number of novel biotech innovations that I hope represent large multi-billion, possibly multi-trillion dollar disruptive planetary-scale market opportunities. 



## Background

A mycologist, an evolutionary biologist, a rocket-scientist, a molecular electrochemist, an electronics engineer, and AI+robotics engineer all walk into a pub .. they have a few drinks, and together they MIGHT accidentally conceive Fungible.Farm. 

My early Internet systems skills have helped me find/discover & pursue Intellectual-obscura as an autodidiact using online resources, schools, etc. (the not-generally known physics effects, manufacturing technicals, inventions lost to time).  Intellectual-obscura is uncharacteristically easy to access now that the Internet has cataloged "most" of it during my lifetime, so using TRIZ I can assume that (equipped with the Internet) I have a larger "intellectual toolkit" available than brilliant minds of history.  By accessing the independent research from a plurality of domain specialists to identify "enablement technology" (enablement tech deals with feasability prerequisite(s), such that two or more i.e. #1 enablement A & #2 enablement B are required - must be present to make result #3 C).   By putting each 'enabling technology' together into more complex systems, this is my contribution to evolution & my own transitive humanism -- I'm not actually inventing anything, I'm using already invented/discovered things for applications the inventor/discoverer didn't see or know how to do.  So I'm using TRIZ to pragmatically & incrementally explore the areas that exist between specialized research in concurrently emerging domains (areas where specialists don't frequently overlap, it's "out of field" for them).   Fungible is a combination of emergent tech+intellectual obscura - so looking for Entrepenurial 'high-utility' opportunities exist in-between where multiple domains are well understood for specialists (i.e. As the joke goes:  a mycologist, an evolutionary biologist, a rocket-scientist, a molecular electrochemist, an electronics engineer, and AI+robotics engineer all walk into a pub .. they have a few drinks, and together they MIGHT accidentally conceive Fungible.Farm) .. it's highly intra-disciplinary. 


## Finding uncommon knowledge

But generally my projects (over the course of my entire life) all depend on knowledge that exists outside the 'common knowledge' of the zeitgeist (zeitgeist: the common knowledge & meaning of ideas-words, within the generation of a modern era, as they say science progresses one funeral at a time).  TRIZ speaks to my pragmatic & rationale tendencies - and is most immediately obvious and appropriate methodology for "big projects, magnum opus" spanning decades to contain & de-risk failures, predict success within a human lifetime.   Nothing sucks more than spending a decade or more on a problem and coming up with peanuts.   SpaceX is the only company which I've seen that on some job-applications (i.e. for SpaceX Rocket Scientist) suggests knowing TRIZ is helpful, it's really only suitable for very big complex projects which have multiple areas of risk.  TRIZ is anti-helpful at the outset, because it creates a 'russian nesting doll' syndrome that bigger ideas must be unfurled as small-steps and codified into systems in a long journey.  I could compare this to learning about each types of trees & organism requirements to study the forest as a system.


## Background

In terms of common ground, the starting point - I began my study in cybernetics, began in artifical intelligence, exploring evolutionary computing, and ultimately control systems for accelerated phytogenesis (operational characteristics of martian biospheres seemed like a good '2030 future specialization' to begin in 2014).  

I have entirely pivoted in the past year (during covid) to mycogensis since it's a nascent field with (*i believe) significantly more beneficial impact to humanity, certainly it's got more impact & utility to my 'future' martian colony biosphere project.  (I hope to live-someday & ultimate die/be buried on Mars, and hopefully die peacefully in my bed, rather than from a systems failure of the biosphere I designed! üòÜ)

I am still an extreme phytology nerd -- so it is my hope that cuturally I'd be a good candidate for CEAT  .. I'm very excited about the exciting research in kingdom Plantae too!  ;-)
