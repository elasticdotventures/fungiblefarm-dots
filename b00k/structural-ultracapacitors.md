# Structural Capacitors


Instead of an item having a battery, the non-chemical energy-storage is inside the items non-plastic case or super-structure of the item or machine (such as a drone frame, wing/rotor, or marine hydrofoil).  The systems for producing this are done using lamination of dielectric & selectively doped with 2d turbostratic carbon graphene on semiconductive biofilms which themselves (based on the deposition pattern of the ferrous or conductive material) may present novel electromagentic or photovoltaic properties (examples to follow).


The resulting dilectric substrates allows (for example) placement of sensors or semi-conductive material deposition onto & within a dielectric material such as chitin.  Pure chitin nanofibrils are expected to have high mechanical properties, e.g. tensile strength, compared to regenerated chitin (however no such cultivation mechanism presently exists).  Present day technology uses deacetylated Î²-chitin nanofibrils from marine and research papers ubiquitiously cite that the deacetylation (using HCl acid) destroys the atomic substructure, for this reason Fungible.farm anticipates that our mechatronic application in-situ synthensis during mycellial formation is the 'missing component'.   Chitin is the mycellial material found in mushrooms, but most people will be familiar with marine-chitin which is crab shells (the etymology of the word chitin itself means "crab [shell]" in ancient greek), or insect arthropod exoskeletons (such as beetle claws)which are among the lightest & strongest substances recorded (as measured by Youngs modulus).  Fungible.farm will conduct research to inform the feasability of continous-flow hybrid manufacturing of fungi derived myco-chitin materials in a 'dark-factory' (100% robotically operated wet-lab clean-room) that is dark to avoid contamination from humans & decrease cost of labor. 


I added quotes to "battery" because it's not technically batteries.   Alessandro Volta invented [discovered] the materials to create a voltaic pile in 1800 (the modern precusor, enabling technology for batteries), he was at the time attempting (very unsuccessfully) to deduce & replicate the biological effects evolutionary biology [nature] had already mastered in an electric eel roughly ~200 million years earlier.  Volta found another way to store power, and he died never understanding how an Electric eel physiologically worked, he was 'lucky' and saw an alternating 'stack' pattern in the eel and started to try and replicate it with different metals which he already new were conductive.   Volta's accidental discovery happened because he mostly used materials which were knowing to have measurable ionic & electron charge carrier properties - so he had (in TRIZ terminology) an excellent "luck surface" (he could make better guesses, and happened to discover a natural physics phenomeon).    Volta's discovery had profound impacts for our modern humanism - in fact the term "Voltage" is named after Alessandro!   I am NOT attempting to replace Volta's work, batteries & voltaic piles are electro-chemical, and my search is in pursuit of lightweight solid state & high tensile fabrics which can be wrapped for "structural" applications (these are coloquially called "zero weight" batteries, because the weight is structural & tensile strengths exceeding aluminum & carbon fiber).    The strength of chitin comes from the poly-N-acetylglucosamine hydrogen bonds that connect the polymer strands.   Depending on the alignment & layering of the polymer the final composition can be rigid (like an acrylic or beetle claw) or elastic (like a high tensile fabric) but ultimately it's all same material in different orientations.

So I use the term battery only to make the subject more approachable to non-electrical engineers, the proper term is "ultra-capacitance", there is no electro-chemical reaction.   To finish my narrative - the electric eel incidentally was originally 'discovered' and cataloged ONLY 30 years prior to Volta, his discovery was facilitatied by his own curiousity and studying the earlier work of Carl Linneaus.   Linneaus who is historically attributed with cataloging & introducing the 5 'kingdoms'  (animal, plant, fungi, protist and monera), as well as ALL the latin naming conventions for everything we use today. Volta was reading his work, that lead to the development of voltaic piles, the precursor to batteries.  Unfortunately, shortly thereafter science became much more specialized - electronics engineering and biology diverged as separate fields, resulting in separate disciplines of specialization - so it is unlikely anybody has actually tried to do this, certainly with the enabling technologies I have access to, on paper - a TRIZ analysis suggests this is certainly feasible, but simply overlooked in favor of mostly rare-earth mined metals being used in batteries when there is actually little-to-no explicit physical-law requirements, it's all material science.  (In fact solid state batteries are better in many aspects, especially naturally producing buoyant thermally insultative 'fireproof' structural energy storage devices, have so many applications its difficult to fathom!).
