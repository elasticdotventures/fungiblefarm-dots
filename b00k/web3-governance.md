# Cyber-Governance

        * web3.0 blockchain decentralized governance operational model


As one optimization I'm hoping to also use a cyber-governance model/blockchain-engine because they are just easier to do what I want with but I realize most AU people who are crypto-savvy aren't web3 savvy, but these days all the smarter coders are in web 3.0, so the best place to find talent is to be involved with web3.0.  The smart-contract isn't explicitly necessary to the experiments outlined in Fungible.farm but it is important to the overall organization 'smart-contract' that oversees the experiments, but the mechanisms selected are prone to cognitive automation (robots & rpa cost less than humans). 

So I hope you will at least be curious and allow me, on a future occasion to explain how these gamified organizational patterns encourage engagement with robots, reward positive behavior and WHY that is super important "not optional" in a mostly planned as a bot driven organization.   I call them "svelte companies" those using heavy automata to make sure it stays properly aligned with the goals set by governance and avoid goodharts law for selecting good measures.  The rest is /simply/ functionally written compositional logic codified in a language known as RUST & solidity handlers that can perform tasks composed idiomatically (which mostly eliminates the needs for technical roles such as system-administrators, non-novel programmers (machine translators, interface transformers), generative industrial designers, electronic engineering & material simulation and a broad class of technical toil) when the system is designed with sufficient foresight in a method using open-source tools that can be interconnected with observable messaging queues and ability to time-travel backward or in parallel to earlier/alternate decisions using models under version-control precision "ML/ops" which being from Australia.  I'm guessing even at ANU there are probably very few who have any idea how to do these types of things with version control tools, and even fewer with 30+ years of open-source dev/ops emerging tech intuition & hacker-skills crypto-coin as reward incentive system is better suited to observe and measure agent alignment & success/failure when the measure is simply the pass/fail of acceptance.  I hope this passes the sniff test from a not-exactly but-close enough G/AI perspective.  I hope this explains that the project, it is internally very much an AI NLU governance & operations project.  (This is the only way I'll ever build a company only if I can ensure I need to ultimately employ the fewest number of people possible since humans are the biggest source of contamination, all the processes are designed as continuous flow using vertical 'self stackable' colonies transported by overhead rail) make of compressed bricks of sawdust and other substrates (for doping) and testing, concurrent evolutionary DNA in a simulator and then in IRL.  Humans are only going to contaminate the experiments so the goal is to have a 100% observable system with digital twins objects and highly deterministic ("model friendly") behaviors. During my diligence, I saw your Cybernetics program and now that I realize *who* you are, I'm just going to sort of overshare a lot of the detail with regard to my project & background and sincerely ask for you to review my work, my approach, any feedback & guidance/inclusion in the Cybernetics Program would be appreciated.  So this is my introductory letter, applying for a position in a future cohort and equally keen to work together upon meeting me or reading this.  Thank you again for your time. 





The internal organization has enough moving parts that planning to be crypto-native earlier, 
and use crypto as a client & agency, async-chat approval 'cards' approval project. 

This came from my own work related to the Australian Treasure Office (ATO) 
request for comment on Crypto-Asset Secondary Service Provider Requirements (CASSPr)

        * async chat-based, discussion and online decentrlaized governance over financial transactions (with paranoid cybersec)
        * web2.99 cyber-goverance (blockchain organizational crypto vault & smart-contract
        * software choices that reflect these design decisions to start as 'crypto-native' 
        * operates a crypto-blockchain, in addition to other not-related to crypto:



Fungible.Farm hopes to operate as a distributed autonomous organization with non-custodial machine-agent cyber-governance controls assigned to a technocratic sovereign-national authority.  Giving one or more sovereign nation academic bodies & financial regulators keys to perform data-control protocols & procedures that govern critical aspects of the cyber-governance.  This is a means to block fiduciary misconduct either through intentional or accidental disclosure (getting hacked) by humans as a means to ensure organizational survival. 

The organization will use best-practice 'state-of-the-art' (for APAC) continous integration, continous development (CI/CD) producing both public and private (to the organization) data & process, which voluntariliy (by smart-contract design) will cedes audit & financial controls to sovereign governance & parlimentary bodies as regulatory partners & safe-guard control mechanisms. 

During this research and ultimately to design & sell 3d models of products & services granting "right to fabricate" that will require web3 technology & use standard ERC-20 wallets on the Ethereum L1, Polygon L2 blockchains (with an eye on multi-chain cybersecurity & customer service)

The complexity of the systems which liberally use recently stabilized emergent technology will (hopefully) dissuade future direct copy-cats by providing a large defensible moat until the organization has achieved continous sustainability through an economy of scale.  The goal is for it to be easier to work with Fungible.farm as a partner than attempt to be a competitor in an attempt to dissuade low-utility copycats ideas from emerging and starting independently by providing a fun friendly & fanatical about fungi inclusive decentralized organizational structure beginning in Australia, but spreading globally with the intention to ultimately to assist humanity in mars colonization.
