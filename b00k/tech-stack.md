# ðŸ‘½ Technology

    * use advanced software patterns
        * RUST & cargo based stateful control systems
            * highly advanced programming language, specialized for broad range of systems engineering tasks
            * functional language, designed in 2010, mostly-stablized libraries as described below
            * ultra-concise, deterministic execution, lack of null & memory borrowing approach is more secure & concise
            * compiler is incredibly smart at checking software for a variety of highly technical reasons
            * extensive frameworks & library support: 
            * Solidity
                * Smart Contracts [see crypto.md](crypto.md)
                * Web3 interfaces
            * WASM interfaces, "polyglot, fast"
                * connects many language libraries together
            * WASM => Typescript (vue/web3.js)
                * Web2 & Web3 project language
            * WASM => Python/CFFI interfaces
                * for Pytorch, AI/ML etc. 
                * CadQuery geometry as code
                    * parametrically described geometry as code, command line driven industrial desgin
                    * goal is to produce an algorithm which provides Natural Language Tasks
            * WASM is a poly glot cross language (many to any library translation)
            * RUST is C++ without a null-pointer
            * RUST programs cannot crash (by contract, highly suitable for smart-contracts)
            * RUST compiles natively into a variety of binary formats including RISC-V, allowing development of embedded systems
        * artificial intelligence 
            * NLU generative reinforcement learning
            * 3d generative design & simulation
