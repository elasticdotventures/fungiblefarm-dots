# ðŸ¤– Mechatronics

The proposed mechantronic & electrochemical manufacturing systems proposed are based on existing research that has been published in the last 200 years but not commercialized for this application.  

We live in a cellulose driven renewable economy where fungi are mostly overlooked and principally hand-cultivated using limited tooling.  For this reason the business must in terms of 'potential impact' find suitable historical comparison will use the Cotton Gin (Cotton Engine) in terms of potential significance & impact to society.  

Patented by Eli Whitney in 1793 that is largely acknowledged as initiating both the industrial age of the 1800's and inadvertently being the impetus for the American civil war (since slavery could be replaced by a machine, built & manufactured in the industrial north that was significantly more efficient than the methods in the religious & conservative mostly agrian southern states).  The Cotton Gin automated cotton picking, and quickly spawned a variety of copy-cats devices including 'tractors' that along with modern fertilizer modernized the harvesting of cellulose crops.  ~230 years later we enjoy living in a 'cheap-cellulose' & mostly-petroleum fueled economy, thanks to that invention.



    * mechatronic cultivation of mushrooms 'dark factory'
        * low labor cost, low contamination from humans
        * roughly, mushroom bricks grown in sterile conditions
        * mushroom bricks can make notvel biopolynmers, but also produce Co2
        * Co2 will be captured and turned into SOAP, fresh oxygen will provided using CEAS chambers (Clean Air Energy Storage)
        * for systems reliability & off-grid backup, single unit produces 100w USB-C suitable to charge field robotics
        * units can be parallelized with booster to charge electric vehicles
