# Biosynthetic semiconductors

The resultant vegetal bio-chitin would then be electrochemically processed into doped bio-ceramics for use in lightweight fireproof structural (zero-weight) ultracapacitor ‘batteries’ using an additive manufacturing process with laser fusing of metals such as graphene, phosphorous, or copper deposition would produce bio-transistors for electronics & sensors ideally suitable for robotic exoskeletons or wearable integrated biosynthetic e-textiles.
