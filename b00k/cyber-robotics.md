# Robotic Exoskeletons


I’m starting with myco-digested e-waste to produce 'space-age' materials - immediately the global demand for bio-chitin lightweight ultracapactive robotic exoskeletons, airfoils & hydrofoils should be immense.   

The global demand for robotics will likely explode soon, well beyond current industrial applications & home vacuums.  

These processes proposed by FF will hopefully obsolete Li chemical batteries & exoskeletons due to the structural nature of the shape, zero weight batteries have applications in aerospace, marine, farm and transportation delivery vehicles. 
 
I can only presume that there will be sufficient consumer demand for electric vehicles and robotics with integrated bioorganic exoskeletons, wings & structural batteries ‘at any cost’ due to their strength to weight advantages over materials such as aluminum.  My intuition tells me it is probably possible to create superior materials which are highly cost-competitive within this decade using genetic engineering along with robotic cultivation & processing and so that is what I will attempt to do.
