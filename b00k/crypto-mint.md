# Smart Contracts




The blockchain aspects/benefits add a plurality of benefits that _hopefully_ warrant the additional complexity:
    * this is envisioned as an ERC-1155 & 4626 Tokenized Vault contract
    * paranoid cyber-security in a decentralized cyber-governance, multi-signatory governance & oversight
    * simplified scalable accounting & books & schedules are "open" records, well suited to audit & compliance tasks can be automated with reports and do not incur significant administrative overhead. 
    * non-custodial smart-contract governed token vaults eliminate a variety of problems associated with custodial governance (constrains dodgy actors, eliminates phishing, smshing to steal company funds, etc)
    * this project has an additional goal of seeking & encouraging new forms of regulatory oversight & governance control within the agency as a form of technocratic & corporate engagement as a part of a broader trans-humanist socialization goal. 
    * async chat is easy/simple interface for cognitive agents incentivization & gamified reinforcement learning
    * web3 ordering interface & manufacturing smart-contracts is 'best interface' for such tasks
    * pre-sales & consumer-voting can _potentially_ be performed to gauge market demand for such products and perform data-driven decision making. 
    * crypto aspects providing 'gating barrier to entry' at the beginning to hopefully restrict demand (the goal isn't to be profitable for profits!, it's to perform profitable research)
    * crypto aspects such as 'governance tokens' provide additional forms of liquidity & fund-raising in addition to traditional banks/VC's in a fair and level playing field. 
    * potential for 'generative' NFT's provide gamifaction for consumer oriented comestibles (food) or surfactants such as soap, but also NFT's could also be serial numbers for proof of ownership or position in a manufacturing queue. 
    * whereas fungible substrates (such as turbostratic graphene) can be represented as commodities reserved in the decentralized ledger. 
    * intended(s) to provide an example non-custodial decentralized organizational governance for research & development organizations. 
    * by operating blockchain network validators & notary nodes can also earn more crypto and provide a sustainable well-spring of internal funding, by providing services to the network it uses in a symbiotic relationship.
    



The goals for the ERC-4626 is 'academic & ministerial invitations' to participate in Web3 federal infrastructure & services such as a national crypto-vault, wallet crypto-asset cybersecurity, and the goal is for fungible.farm to provide some of those services to our governance board, so they can protect the organization, but the governance board will be (ultimately) high level policy makers & ministers.  Ideally setting the bar "very high" in setting technical controls to prevent dodgy actors from performing rug-pulls. 


For those who are invited to join Fungible.farm (and receive governance tokens) -- those are are initially academics, then minsters, and the goal will be ultimately to let the federal government exert their sovereign authority with technical controls (in the ERC-1155 contract) by establishing a industry standard identity mechanism (i.e. an ERC20 wallet) and publish that as a sovereign regulator (initially this will be performed by a quorum of universities, who then hand over control to regulators *someday* symbolically in exchange for the government signing the tokens & agreeing to bond the organization against fiduciary misconduct and it is hopeful that by having strong technical controls (as part of a national solidity #include library) that these types of organizations become more common, versus the antiquated ERC20 (even with multi-signatory custodial controls, which themselves are exceptionally uncommon in Australia due to technical complexity).  The academics inform the fungible.farm policy and the ministerial regulators will ultimately issue land-use grants, bonds & legislatively review + approve 'special use' mechanisms for decentralized what in Australian would be described as (non-custodial) 'cyber-governance' model as a means to inform policy.
