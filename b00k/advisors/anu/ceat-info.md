# CEAT

** THIS CONTENT IS ENTIRELY ASPIRATIONAL **



#  WHY CEAT?
#  Project Goals

Fungible.farm is a project started in 2014 and was not expected to finish until 2030. I am from the United States but have recently expatriated to Australia post-covid. 

I think Fungible.farm ideally my long-term goal is a next generation Rural Development Corporation for Mycology & Biosynthetic polymers. 

The biosynethic polymers isn't "sexy", so I like to talk about structural ultracapacitors and how these methods can manufacture those. 

# My Expectations

Australian is not my native language and so expressing ideas & approaches due to my unfamiliarness with the rules and processes - how does a research project in Australia move forward at the fastest pace: work with the schools and CSIRO for development of agriculture technologies. I would like to be pragmatic and present this project in it's present state.  

# Physical space
    * CEAT: Centre for Entrepeneurial Agri-Technology
    https://ceat.org.au/

# NOTICE

There is no formal relationship with CEAT beyond an informal convo. 

This is not presently proven or academically reviewed research.

I am preparing this repo to provide citations which suggests this is certainly possible using one or more methods within the TRIZ/TIPS framework. 

# Semiconductors & CEAT

I'm also going to assume nobody at CEAT knows much about the specialized field of semiconductor manufacturing, what is most important is that the deposition of materials must occur in-situ during myco-cultivation using robotic methods with accuracy measured initially in micrometers and ultimately *GOAL perhaps in nanometers (for transitive effects, the distance and materials between two semiconductors influences the "band gap" or "energy gap" properties, dictates the properties of how electrons move through a material).  Semi-conductor fabrication uses processes called photo lithography & laser-trimming to control layered material deposition --  I am capable (possessing the skillset) to produce robotics that I hope will ultimately mimic these methods within biological organisms.  I do not expect CEAT to have this expertise, although I'll be surprised if CSIRO doesn't have at least a few people on staff who are more adept than myself.

My obstacle to CEAT collaboration is to discuss/explain how it is likely possible to (in the right environment) grow organisms with semiconducting properties.  I'm hoping that if this is reviewed by CSIRO they can provide a high level signal that says "Yes" or "No" for program fitment within the [MSeq.vc](mseqdotvc.md)

# Access to Resources & Networking

I work in a bubble. 

I spend most of my time finding an expert or answer in a particular field, consuming the entirety of their publications, and then (if needed) I can sometimes write/ask/pay for their time to pick their brain on how to setup novel experiments & eliminate, mitigate (or constrain) the potential causes of failure.  No matter how much money I have for research, I can't buy 'time', there are no time-machines.  The cost of a ruined experiment - the set back, especially when it is attributed to my own human error or ignorance is the most frustrating setback as an independent inventor & researcher.   

# Entrepeneurial Assist. 

I realize the advantages of being pure research.  I'm hopeful CEAT can pair my technical skill with one or more executive leaders (or aspiring students) who enjoy socializing. 

One Goal for CEAT collaboration -- to reduce the time & energy required to create a successful [desired] outcome which is ultimately an Entrepreneurial pursuit. 

I hope to have experiments work - or to at least "know why they failed", so that one or more answers can be found in the first few rounds of attempts, and the effect(s) to be repeatable thereafter
(that is the goal, produce repeatable & experiments that requisite to commercial "Entrepreneurial" viability). 

# Obstacles


CEAT facilities are potentially equipped or could be equipped in a climate controlled container on/near campus for small mycology experiments  - often reproducing research done by others with slight modifications (i.e. my systems) for empirical 'proving' reasons (*small steps towards a bigger goal, building layers of knowledge).  These small experiments are precursors "proofs" to demonstrate the feasability of a bigger system-design approach.  The ultimately goal 'end result' is written in blue below.   But to explain the 'how' is more interesting.

# Why ANU/CEAT & RDC

 I was referred to CEAT & ANU Cybernetics by the Waite Research Institute in Adelaide. 

 To provide context term "RDC" they are a Agriculture Research Development Corporation in Australia. 


I reached out to CEAT in the hope that it would provide a potentially a 'better place' in Australia for me to conduct my research than my garage.  

Innovation in Australia is very difficult outside a school since even obtaining business permits presumes one is doing research within one or more fields that presently have business classifications, OHS, insurable, etc.  This research is sufficiently "out there" that it doesn't appear in the drop-down list of classifications and has lead me to the allure of an RDC. 

I am looking for a 'best fit' base of operations ANU/CEAT which will provide the 'largest luck' surface for a long term RDC. 

ANU is best school for my project: 
    - specialized in agriculture development re: CEAT
    - cybernetics is most appropriate domain (I believe) related to my research project "fungible.farm" that is looking for a home in academic sponsor.
    - ANU may be more appropriate for less-mainstream research so those projects can gain a bit more visibility and supervision in Canberra at the national level. 

# What am I doing today?

I am presently engaged in the web3 recruiting platform candi-date.xyz
which will serve as a "ai resume-tinder" to filter applicants and obviate various HR tasks to automated systems.    

Setting up Crypto systems to fund the research indefinitely, and now feeling the pinch of the crash. 



All roads point to the easy path forward being "What is the best way to align & collaborate with Cybernetics @ ANU" so I am keen to present what I am working on in this github document.  

This project documentation is stored in a Github Repo.  Questions or edits to this document are welcome using github http://elasticventures/fungiblefarm-dots
