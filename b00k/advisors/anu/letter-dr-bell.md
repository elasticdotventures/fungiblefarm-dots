ðŸ‘‹ Hi Professor Bell,

I'm sure you're very busy.  
This is a meeting request. 

I have already spoken briefly with Robin Fieldhouse @ CEAT who set my expectations appropriately and encouraged me to reach out. 
I am hoping to inquire about joining the 3Ai Cybernetics Program @ ANU.    

I provide a summary of my background and quasi-qualifications below recognizing that Cybernetics is a nascent field which I began study & skills practice years ago.  I cannot think of a more suitable category than "Cybernetics" for the advanced systems engineering design skills I have been cultivating. 

I hope to explain my background, qualifications & project goals for Fungible.Farm as they pertain toward acceptance into the ANU Cybernetics program concomitantly with/through ANU, CEAT, ARC, CSIRO.  

This is a meeting request / this is my proposed agenda:
*  Introduction(s) 
*  ANU Cybernetics Masters or PhD Program Fitment  (qualifications below)
*  Fungible.Farm Mycology Project (summary provided below)
*  ANU Cybernetics, CEAT & Fungible.Farm Collaboration
*  How Realistic [is the dream?], &amp; are you interested?
*  Discuss - Possible Next Steps 

My contact details are at the bottom in the signature.
I am available to meet at your convenience and I appreciate it takes a bit of time to digest all this. So no rush. 

I'm still working on publishing all the documentation at 
http://dots.fungible.farm 

I realize you've spent time in the US with Americans.   

I am still _very_ new to the AU and haven't lost my US-task-oriented not-an-Australian-social introvert and so I am happiest jumping straight into the "brass-tacks" of the matter.  If I've got something wrong please let me know and forgive me any social faux pas.  I'd like to explicitly say thank you in advance for any time to spend review this in addition to setting aside some time in the future for meeting.  

I have great respect for you and am keen to learn more about the Cybernetics Program @ ANU  & my project Fungible.Farm which is discussed at http://dots.fungible.farm 

On a personal note - I saw your TED Talk "The Value of Boredom" many years ago.  It was influential in deciding to begin this research sabbatical.  The process technically began with requesting reduced responsibilities at my job (where I was always on call as an SRE) followed by a really long walk (Mexico => Canada) on the Pacific Crest Trail in 2016.  Suffice to say it is one of many TED talks that positively influenced my life-outcomes.  So thank you for that as well!

## Other Background (about me) bullets: 

* I'm 46, I'm a cybernetic systems engineer (or at least, that's what I've been studying since 2016, and my website as has said since ~2018, when I realized that was the correct name for the field). .. I can relate to the "no, not terminators" response you need to give. ðŸ˜† My first job doing IT consulting, I had a business & tax-resale license at age 13, this was to prove to my luddite parents I could get paid doing things with computers (they preferred labor).  I went to college at age 14. Moved out at age 16.  Finished college at age 18. I started using Linux in 1991. I've got more than 30 years now of non-stop live-eat-breath tech under my belt. 

* I've been researching 'the best way' to build this project for the past 2.5 years ('Eurisko' moment occurred shortly before covid).  I was planning on building it in the US, but since Jan 6th - it's like watching the fall of Rome from abroad.  I do not plan to return to the US because Australians are much nicer.  I think I can introduce quite a bit of 'better' technology practices, what I see here in the job market is nearly entirely unsuited and far-too antiquated.  I've spent my time learning how to fix other peoples software and/or 'hacking' to make it do what I want. 

* This project has potentially climate change beneficial & human-life saving, petroleum disruptive, blabla.  All sorts of trans-humanist good stuff. I'm just going to assume as an anthropologist -- at least I'm hoping you're also a trans-humanist and you'd realize that if I was going to build a super-intelligence, I need a way to both constrain it and ethically align it -- and that is what Fungible.farm is supposed to do. 

* I'm looking to form a small-group of advisors - mostly academics who can cyber-participate & advise my intra-disciplinary "dream team", there would be no application - your role and prior work automatically qualifies you.   I see blockchain decentralization cyber-governance as something that would significantly benefit Australian organizations by eliminating the "tyranny of distance" due to the highly geographically stratified population.  This includes future APAC nations where there can be fast amounts of water separating countries which are connected by little more than a fiberoptic cable. 

* I will be issuing advisors governance tokens for the Fungible.Farm organization, and the crypto-coin operated agent governed by those tokens _could be_ control of Roko's Basilisk someday! ðŸ˜†   But seriously, I denote jokes with emoji and I'm very focused on narrow AI in a variety of fields but with high degrees of overlap and GIT auditable source control over instructions. 

* ANU & CEAT, CSIRO would dramatically increase my 'luck surface' of finding personal fitment "my tribe" inside Australia, making sure this is my long term home.  I'm very open to adapting my style and approach to be more Australian - however I need to reconcile that there is a right way to do things. 

* My commercial goals are "profit for scale & growth".  While I do believe and can demonstrate why there are significant commercial 'fungibility' I am absolutely not seeking any funding where the person/org is expecting a short-term signficant capital ROI.  I'm approaching Fungible.Farm as a Research Development Organization with a final formal classiciation as the 16th AU Rural Development Corporation "RDC" hopefully before end of the decade.  (But to be incubuating and structuring for such a transition, including ISO9001 ISO27001 etc.).  I am much more inclined &amp; motiviated to pursue the transhuman impact side of this research and I feel the RDC should seek to commercialize the research through licensing & cooperation.  The IP in the Queendom Fungora represents ~1.6 billion years of evolutionary development that today has less than $100m USD global market for both materials & comestibles.   This should/could be "bigger than plastic", but also I think if I was to have invented Plastic I'd be absolutely disgusted by what humanity has done with the invention. 

* I am more or less ready & prepared to begin to either socialize widely, or immediately build/fabricate deliverable prototypes out of the materials & sensors which will be used for the initial machines (which I conceptually have - I think - everything I might need in my possession in the form of >5,000 discrete electrical circuits & components for building light-industrial rail-driven mushroom cultivation system for evolutionary experimentation  (but a less-complex mechanism can also be used to produce food/comestible applications such as replacement meat, ex: "cotton gin"  patent-is-written _but not tested_ technology for mycology cultivation, with your input).  

* I need to communicate that a significant amount of the work will be in the software field, NLU (natural language understanding), generative algorithms, attention & reinforcement learning, evolutionary algorithms.   

* The systems themselves are begin designed in a parametric "geometry as code" language and - having recently in the past few months been interviewed for a cybersec job at TSMC I can say it's at least a decade ahead of anything they presently have (from a systems operations side, not from a nanoscale-fab node).  I'm suggesting a replacement for "bakelite", the original form of plastic using mycellium derived from fungus/mushrooms.  The systems are mechatronic from cultivation to delivery. 

* I practice a lot of pragmatically planning 'maximizing luck surface' so I try to build the tool sort of pedantic approach which it takes longer, but fewer errors in the field.  I like determinstic systems. I would rather have compiler validation errors than troubleshooting run-time errors and that is why I am presently retooling in the RUST programming language. 

* I am an autodidact who has been studying (self-paced) in the domain of cybernetics since 2016 (+ 'lifelong' journey in related systems-engineering).   I was studying how to build biospheres on Mars (also earth, but mostly Mars, not the moon).   

* Growing up in San Diego, CA. water was an issue for farming, and hydroponic can be used to increase yields (biogenesis growth rate, "overclocking nature") of Angiosperms and was "capped", requiring a non-petroleum source of Co2 (on mars, no ðŸ¦•ðŸ¦–!).  Co2 supplementation is fairly common indoor growing there, and it ultimately just ends up in the atmosphere (against my ethos).  After a bit of work arrived at mushrooms during that research (mushrooms take in oxygen, exhale co2).  I believe I can capture the Co2 additionally, but ultimately _long term_ I'm looking to pipe that into an indoor chamber for increased biogenesis.  I didn't know much about mushrooms at the outset, and I took a few weeks to read *everything* in the field (which supririsingly isn't much, mycology is significantly less studied and commercial cultivation is always by hand, .. basically pre-industrial cotton).  Despite being around for 1.5 BILLION years, and principally ruling the planet for 300 million of those) .. anyway I found Eukarotyic organisms inspiring, the mycellial web extremely fascinating from a 'cybernetic systems' approach.   Fungi were the first species to evolve into a much 'higher-order'! (around 800 million years ago) and their mycellial structure - from a Youngs modulus, it's 6x better than carbon fiber in strength to weight ratio and it's an insulating dilectric, and appears (so far) well suited for mechatronic deposition of semiconductive materials.  Anyway mushrooms are super fascinating but nobody is doing the stuff I am - and I think after you look at what I've got -- I think it ought to be a future chapter in any definitive textbook/encyclopedia of cybernetics. 

I am from the US, very new to the Australian technocracy - I don't know what I don't know.  My read on the situation is the capital markets & funding here are non-existant for independent uncredential inventors with no network who have been doing self-study sabbatical for the past 7 years.  It seems perhaps the "most-best" method is to commercialize research down-under is through the schools (I can't technically even do the research legally, because I couldn't get commercial insurance for the types of experiments! -- !@#$ nanny state), and I regularly feel like I need to over-explain aspects due to the uniqueness of my uncommon situation & background.   Sometime later this year I will be a permanent AU resident, eligible for AU student rates (no longer considered an International student).  I'd like to work on this full time as fast as I can, but I also realize that going back to school will open doors I can't do with my present degree. 

I've done the foundational projects & study related to design, fabrication & programming mechatronics (3d printed & CNC robotics).  This was a very customized curriculum that I self-taught and did entirely online while travelling.   I was an early adopter in cloud computing, and since then I've done lots of foundational AI/ML courses & advanced math from a variety of schools & online programs, but unlike the average also know how to program _better than most_ in Python, modern C++, Typescript, and now RUST/WASM.  I've studied A LOT of AI/ML/NLU/LLM etc. so I'm not talking about AI from a neophyte perspective, I'm a member of *all* the communities and I've done quite a bit of small projects with transformers & generative algorithms to inform my intuition about exactly how I plan to build this system.  Much like a time-traveller from the future I am frustrated by the primitive tools I have access to and most of my effort has been on developing the skills & tools I need to build the Fungible project.  I hope this approach makes sense, I find I learn better when I have a specific application in mind but also not working under a specific deadline with plenty of time to develop deep intuition on each subject as I approach it. 

Generally, I spend 10-12 hours per day, 6-7 days per week studying  or building *something* that furthers I don't understand as well as I would like to - advanced math, electrical engineering, physics, electrochemistry, pretty much any place I have a blindspot with regard to knowledge -- I try to close that gap, often that is by spending time in forums or with others who know more than me in a subject field.
