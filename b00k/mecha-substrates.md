# Substrates

    * fabrication of methods & mechanics to produce turbostratic 'Flash' graphene
        * evaluate input materials for application suitability
        * johnson 'magic' angle deposition of graphene
        * producing conductive & ferrous threads, filaments, inks, and acids
        * additive deposition and synthethsis of molecular substrates (on a tape/conveyor)
    * targeting 2d structural ultra-capacitance 
        * (energy storage, like a battery but not chemical)
        * several order of magnitude better than 
    * targeting 2d graphene electrodes
        * same material, different molecular configuration
