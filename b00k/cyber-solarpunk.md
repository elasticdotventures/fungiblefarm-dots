# SolarPunk

SolarPunk is a movement in biophilic architecture, using natural construction materials and incorporating living organisms, moving water (often for heating/cooling). 

Fungible Farm came from GPB "GrowPotBot" a separate project in hydroponics & control systems for future martian colonies.  The project needed a reliable (non-petroleum) source for Co2 and several options were considered prior to arriving at mushrooms/fungi, discovering Chitin and learning of it's atomic properties. 

The research suggests that vegetable bio-chitin using additional manufacturing processes could also be useful to fabricate transparent agri-voltaics, biophilic construction materials, and wearable e-textiles (colloquially “conductively doped mushroom leather”).  All of these are imho ‘better than plastics & cellulose’ in nearly every measurable dimension - except commercial availability.

The FF & GPB are synergistic systems that work together to perform accelerated biogenesis “Krebs Cycle” facilitated by hydroponic sensors in an indoor/sheltered growing environment that can outperform outdoor farming.  

The technology is designed to be “sold in Ikea” safe & end-user friendly and includes a variety of observable sensors & wifi.   Using the cloud multiple systems can collaboratively perform multi-variant phenomic testing of growth factors such as temperature, fluence-rate, nutrient density, airflow, and other factors such as ‘intentional hormesis’ which allow life to be observed & modelled as a system of electrochemically induced inputs & outputs for yield optimization (larger, faster harvests). 

I hope to demonstrate a 100% sustainable “mars-colonization” scalable-manufacturing that can be replicated using only sunlight and limited water.   Please note, in all cases these are not technologies I developed, rather these were developed and academically reported but never commercialized -- frequently due to a lower cost, less sustainable alternative being available.
