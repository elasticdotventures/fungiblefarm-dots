## üï∏Ô∏è Web 3.0 Ordering

 Clients will first register at fungible.farm web3.0 interface using an ERC-20 wallet and upload 2d SVG layers & 3d models (STL &amp; URDF) with a brief 'tweet sized' description of the intended application & country it will be delivered (or pickup in Australia).   The fabrication method(s) are simulated by machine learning to develop plans & anticipate best-worst electro-mechanical & structural properties (weight, youngs modulus, pv, etc.) & time+cost to cybernetically grow & fabricate the item in a hybrid manufacturing process along with setup-tooling & expected shipping costs.  Quickstarts will be designed for each of the product categories mentioned above to reduce the end-user complexity &amp; use client-industry specific jargon to create a web3 "Order Preview". 

 Assuming the client is satisified with the order preview a solidty smart-contract "purchase order" offer is generated for a future capacity-reservation(s) using secure crypto-currency (ETH2 L1, Polygon L2).  
 
 PUrchase orders are reservations for time & materials receive a place in mfg. queue & substrate allocations which may be sold or deferred to others who may desire a "rush order" (either position & time and materials are fungible represented as crypto-commodities which become property of the client), this includes orders for less technical comestible mushrooms & co2 soap which are among the first the first two commodites that are expected to come online to prove the system (in parallel with other development).  Cancellations & in-situ fabrication abortions will receive partial credit per the terms of the contract.  Tooling may be retained provided the customer pays a lease, and all orders rates are differenty for prototype vs. discounts for long-term capacity reservations. 

Customers interact with a task-oriented friendly no-gender-pronoun-yei asynchronous chatbot-driven organization &amp; decentralized cyber-governance (as a client, they may receive various crypto-oriented incentives & rewards, including temporary custody of governance tokens).
