# *.Fungibles



Industrial applications include using hybrid manufacturing methods to make capactive biofilms and lightweight high-tensile (Youngs modulus) strength structural ultra-capacitors which would then be sold or shipped directly to consumers.  

    * mechatronic fabrication of 
        * novel synthetic bio-polymers & bio-films
        * made from fungi & optionally other fibers
        * bio-transitive &  (can control electricity, fabric circuit boards, energy-storage) 
        * Co2 sequester SOAP & Flash Graphene
        * Flash-Graphene (for supercapactive research)
