# Co2 Sequestration

The "Co2 into SOAP" idea was inspired by:
https://cleano2.ca/


Fungible.Farm came about during research attempting to discover a non-petroleum source of Co2 to accelerate biogensesis in angiosperms during increased periods of light-fluence.  Most plants are lazy and only use 1% of the sunlight. 

There may be some questions about how much co2 sequestration can be performed with this project given the relative small size of a mushroom.

Growing that one pound of mushrooms is so efficient, in fact, that it generates just 0.7 pounds of CO2 equivalents.

The study finds 'conventional' production of a pound of mushrooms requires only 1.8 gallons of water and 1.0 kilowatt hours of energy, and generates only .7 pounds of CO2 equivalent emissions. In addition, the annual average yield of mushrooms is 7.1 pounds per square foot â€“ meaning up to 1 million pounds of mushrooms can be produced on just one acre.

Nobody starts at scale, first we built small prototypes, but then we get bigger.  

Let's get wrapped around the key elements, by describing the parts & size.
First, this is potentially massively tall vertical farms of mushrooms, so the density could increase considerably.   
The airflow should *ideally* be recycled in a closed loop with an indoor hydroponic greenhouse. 

The goal is to produce very big structures, airfoils, wings, hulls for super-tanker sized ships using large additive printers & wrapped semi-conductive films & biopolymers.  The composite material of myco-chitin has material properties which are stronger than carbon fiber so it's is well suited to make a variety of novel 'big things' at potentially 1/10th the present day weight (on a boat, this would translate to significantly less drag, and the chitin is hydrophobic).  

I am hoping to obtain a "clean o2" unit, or obtain permission (from the founder) to replicate key pieces of the technology, or find similar technology for scrubbing co2 carbon from the air.   Ultimately I expect to be able to produce biofilms which can also do this. 


The internal AI design system as proposed is expected to theorize & design machines that perform fabrication plans for objects of any size. 

Ultimately a single system for any scale, sort of "automated shipyard" except it's growing mushrooms and the containers aren't nearly as bit (at first).  And the output is Co2 SOAP & coffee-reclaimed flash-Graphene 2d carbon which is conductive and can be used in recycled plastic filaments, threads, and ink.   It can also *potentially* be deposited in superconductive patterns and agents role is to find the most superconductive pattern over a series of generations, discovery by generative design & analysis operated on a (nominal cost) pay-to-play virtual game-based simulation algorithms & model generator is the pre-sales engine and interactivy (collaboratively human-agent) designed models.
