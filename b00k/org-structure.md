# Org Structure

It's all about expontential growth by consuming waste inputs, and the projects I'm covering including meat replacement, atmospheric moisture farming from clean-air-energy storage using 'second-life' solar panel recovery (from upgraded/replaced PV systems), which are in various stages of incubation, BUT my project deals with fungi derived biopolymers.  The whole thing runs on trash & waste inputs.
