high level: "seed" funding is usually 1:1 .. 
I call this model "spore" funding is 1 to many.   fungible.farm is both crypto & fungi, so it is creatively blending the two aspects in it's communication.  
a single mushroom can produce ~16 billion spores.  
It's all about expontential growth by consuming waste inputs, and the projects I'm covering including meat replacement, atmospheric moisture farming from clean-air-energy storage using 'second-life' solar panel recovery (from upgraded/replaced PV systems), which are in various stages of incubation, BUT my project deals with fungi derived biopolymers.  The whole thing runs on trash & waste inputs.
