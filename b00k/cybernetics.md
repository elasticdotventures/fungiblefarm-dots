# Cybernetics

Cybernetic Systems Engineering can explore terrestrial applications of astrobotany, including mycological remediation of soil & accelerating biogenesis using machine learning/data science.

Cybernetic systems engineering “CSE” is part of control theory envisioned in the 1940’s but was an unsuitable career during the AI winter of my youth so I followed as an observer.  Cybernetic systems are control systems for biological organisms (not skynet).  As a CSE I can build, program & repair my own scientific instruments to supervise and develop robotic cultivation & manufacturing of biological organisms using a stateful & distributed computing cloud.  


The "why & what" is important and simultaneously understanding the "trees" is only one way to approach studying the "forest". 

But more broadly -biological control systems 'cybernetics' are perhaps the most self-sustainable & scalable means for production / continous replication of organisms.

I was very happy to learn ASU Canberra is one of the only a handful of schools in the world that offers a cybernetics program. 

I would say I've been studying the foundational technologies for cybernetics / biological control theory since 2014, a field at the time which was only 60 years old (cybernetics as a field was incepted in 1954 - so it's still very nascent).   

 I can demonstrate this in my past projects to establish credability if you require, but I lack traditional academic qualifications.  No time to pursue degrees, too busy learning out in the field! 

Cybernetics involves & crosses several different domains of science & technology.  This project covers mycology, mechatronic cultivation, cyber-governance using blockchain, network validators & smart-contracts, various types of physics simulators and several specialized domains of artifical intelligence including natural language understanding (NLU), generative 3d evolutionary algorithms that use reinforcement learning from both agent-agent & agent-human interaction.  

Collectively the term "cognitive agents" and explores a plurality of alignment-problems in both electro-mechanical and ethical agent domains.
