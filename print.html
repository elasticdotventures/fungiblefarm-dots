<h1 id="welcome-to-fungiblefarm-"><a class="header" href="#welcome-to-fungiblefarm-">Welcome to Fungible.Farm 🍄+🤖+🕸️=👋</a></h1>
<p>This is the public fungible.farm documentation &amp; planning repository which is hosted at <a href="http://dots.fungible.farm">http://dots.fungible.farm</a></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Fungible.Farm is a green-impact research-oriented quasi-commercial poly-disciplinary crypto-native cyber-governance entity.  There are no analogues or parallels in similar companies or methods, Fungible.farm produces cybernetic myco-agriculture systems using sustainable methods informed principally by reproducing uncommercialized academic research.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The complexity of the operating plan is necessary to achieve 'waste input, fungible output' with negative-carbon footprint, 
and 'do no harm' only positive environmental &amp; societal impact while operating trading within a capitalist society using crypto &amp; web3.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Most startups don't begin with such arduous constraints or ambitious goals, but half-measures &amp; the old-methods persist wasteful anti-patterns, by integrating several pieces of new technology to spawn a post-waste 'solar punk' bio-industrial era &amp; help modern humanity avoid triggering a post-anthropocene epoch.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="-the-elevator-pitch"><a class="header" href="#-the-elevator-pitch">🛗 The Elevator Pitch</a></h2>
<p>Australian geographic, US high-tech cybernetic agriculture methods to cultivate mushrooms &amp; fungi using AI in a <em>mostly</em> mechatronic <em>lights-out</em> wet-lab.  Self-sufficient methods for continous-flow electro-chemical fabrication of turbostratic graphene, ferrous &amp; carbon substrates as fungible commodities and substrates (for use in 3d filaments, conductive inks).</p>
<p>Substrates are additively manufactured 'doped' into thin-film elastic biopolymers to create selectively transistive semiconductor patterns (capacitence, logic gates, electromechanical acuators, etc).</p>
<p>Manufacturing systems are TRIZ/TIPS designed for <em>small but scalable</em> continous operations that individually are zero-waste negative-carbon proof-of-concept prior to superscalar facilities being developed.  (All profit is for sustainable growth &amp;&amp; ongoing research, future Mars-tech).</p>
<p>Methods &amp; patents proposed operate almost entirely on sustainable or anthropocene remediated waste-inputs to produce:  1.)  fungible comestibles (mushrooms, meat alternatives)  2.) Co2 sequestered soap  &amp; 3.) energy-storage solid-state ultra-capacitors with a high-Youngs modulus for use in washable e-fabrics, construction, and structural applications such as wings, airfoils, drone chassis &amp; robotic exoskeletons.</p>
<h2 id="-impact-statement"><a class="header" href="#-impact-statement">🦖 Impact Statement</a></h2>
<p>Each cybernetic system has one or more sustainable (usually waste) inputs and outputs must be 'fungible' (or have utility value, purpose for another system within fungible.farm).    The ordering &amp; end-user interfaces are described in Web3.0 section.<br />
🤓  This repository will break down the method(s) within the madness.</p>
<h2 id="-queendom-fungora--fungiblefarm-thesis"><a class="header" href="#-queendom-fungora--fungiblefarm-thesis">🍄 Queendom Fungora &amp; Fungible.Farm Thesis</a></h2>
<p>Fungible.farm is leveraging 'neo-modern' tech but mostly tapping into roughly 1.5 billion years of &quot;uncommercialized&quot; evolutionary learning in queendom fungora.  For at least 800 million years these magnificient species rules the planet prior to the arrival of Plantae &amp; mammals. </p>
<p>So we're going to use evolutionary tech from yesterday to produce novel inventions that will reshape your tomorrow - just wait!</p>
<p>Modern &quot;green&quot; economy is a cellulose driven renewable economy and Fungible.Farm is going to mycologically remediate this planet (and someday terra-form others) with the technology that will be demonstrated.  These methods described are novel, but are informed by experiments done in laboratories and never commercialized. </p>
<p>Everything in the business plan is green tech, and comes from a waste input, 100% of the outputs are comestible, green, co2 sequested, life-saving applications. Green tech was chosen not for it's impact but for it's ability to scale to planetary size &amp; inpsire young minds about a solar-punk utopian future.</p>
<p>Fungible.farm is intentionally engineered to run sustainably at a carbon deficit (negative footprint), this is not an accident.  The original ideas were intended to fabricate &amp; support durable highly-resilient biospheres on Mars where is there is NO PETROLEUM.  (🦕 at least as far as we know 😜) and it is equally unlikely that a future mars or lunar colony will run at optimium efficiency &amp; reliability without the systems described herein. </p>
<p>Fungible.farm incorporates several trans-human poly-social impacting many areas where humanity is presently faltering and unsustainable and the only way we're going to get our solar punk utopian future is not going to happen by building a system using the historical anti-patterns &amp; operating methods.  Fungible.farm is built to run 'alongside' capitalism, but not necessarily full embrace it with more altrustic goals than increasing our shareholder dividends - we aren't anti-capitalism, we're simply pro-transhumanism.</p>
<p>Certainly such ambitious goals should require a bit of engineering and validation and that's what we're doing.   However because the systems use mostly artificial intelligence once they are online, when it's onine it won't be moving a the same pace as your traditional companies do!  (our algorithms don't sleep, they don't need vacations or get sick, they work 7/24 - and they validate crypto-currency so when they aren't learning they are earning!)  .. also we don't hire more people we just auto-scale more cloud-resources, operating with the idea that every task 'toil' should only be done once and 'overhead' should be minimized. </p>
<p>Pronouns, everybody is a &quot;they&quot;, or we say &quot;yei&quot; as a universal pronoun for all human genders including cyborgs.  Fungible.Farm operations are spares on humans, heavy on cognitive algorithms.  Commercial applications to create &quot;profit&quot; will be used for more research and growth, driving costs and creating more novel products over the next decade.  The bigger the organization becomes the more 'green impact' this becomes, we call this &quot;spore&quot; funding (a single mushroom can produce 16 billion spores, each producing a new &amp; novel fungi depending on the substrate that spore lands on). </p>
<p>The organization is extremely high-tech &amp; mostly software-driven interface and utilizes a plurality Artificial Intelligence and few humans for overhead.  This is better because humans are bacteria ridden dirty animals and vectors for contagion in a 'dark' wet-lab &amp; manufacturing process, our robotics are easier to santize &amp; sterilize.</p>
<p>Cybernetics is a discipline of 'systems engineering'.   When engineering software systems it is a series of choices about which standards &amp; methods to choose before the first line of code is written, the system must work &quot;on paper&quot;.  Principal research began on the precursor system in 2016 in the US and was subsequently moved to Australia in 2020 during covid.  Small tests &amp; research has been done to further specific intuition on ambiguous areas. </p>
<p>The outline(s) below are conceptual project outline, components and systems that are in various stages of being built and will need to interoperate.</p>
<p>The initial focus is fast-prototyping &amp; tooling, &amp; software simulation &amp; delivery systems &amp; products.  Presently looking for a place to create a small-scale 'proof of viability' end-to-end system, that will ultimately inform the bigger version (someday). </p>

<h2 id="-green-tech"><a class="header" href="#-green-tech">🌱 Green Tech</a></h2>
<p>All processes proposed within the Fungible project consume one or more abundant (mostly cellulose) waste inputs, and produce one or more &quot;Fungible&quot; (consumer &amp; or industrial sale-able) outputs during each experiment &amp; operational phases.</p>
<p>Some of the earliest planning are to inform the organizational tooling related to the &quot;end goals&quot; of the system, which is directly: climate impact, through innovation &amp; disruption of petroleum. </p>
<p>The plan is to be successful, so the system is designed to handle and operations become easier with more success, which is known as an &quot;anti-fragile&quot; business operating plan.  The first product is the most difficult to build &amp; sell, so the first products are intentionally easy and low-risk (substrates, mushrooms &amp; co2 soap) because they are hard to screw up even with robotics, but they prove &amp; inform the future robotics subsystems.</p>
<h2 id="the-executive-faq"><a class="header" href="#the-executive-faq">The Executive FAQ</a></h2>
<h3 id="can-this-be-simplified"><a class="header" href="#can-this-be-simplified">Can this be simplified?</a></h3>
<p>The core idea(s) of Fungible may seem a bit overwhelming at first glance because it is poly-disciplinary with each mission &amp; goal synergistically supporting eachother.  It is very technologically heavy and it presumes that some research can be reproduced or integrated in ways it has not necessarily been done <em>yet</em>.</p>
<p>The crypographic web3.0 elements seem complicated but offer significantly more flexability and also increase the caliber of talent for any human overhead.  Most of the business documentation will be done in code (including this document, is written in a github version control system). </p>
<p>The mushrooms are cultivated by robotics (human cultivation is expensive, and a vector for contamination, also humans aren't good at nano-scale &amp; micro-scale precision fabrication).  100% of present-day mycology is hand-driven, and is perhaps the biggest thing to happen to mushrooms &amp; fungi in the last 800 million years, so if we want to cultivate using robotics (someday at micro &amp; nano scale hybrid bio-manufacturing) we need to get those robots done. </p>
<p>The mushrooms can be grown for food, or to make products with chitin, including novel semi-conductors that are lightweight &amp; high-tensile 'structural energy storage'.  Cybernetics is used to design the systems, and AI is used extensively throughout the business. The Web3 'cyber-governance' business model is a better dojo for AI reinforcement learning.  The 'future' wholesale &amp; retail sales portals will require web3 and the systems are designed for customer visibility.  The nature of 'structural super-capacitors' is perhaps the most ambitious aspect of the project, but the sales portal starts with a simple model of selling &quot;soap&quot; (the kind you wash your hands with), that is mostly environmentally sequestered Co2. </p>
<p>Few if any of the processes presented here exist &quot;today&quot; or the methods remain on the periphery of 'common knowledge'.  Research is cited where it is available and Fungible.Farm mostly seeks to reproduce research that was not commercialized. </p>
<p>Fungible.farm includes being 100% to be green-energy powered and have a negative carbon deficit design the Fungi producing Co2 during transpiration &amp; mycogensis. Further, low cost, low emissions PoS (proof of stake) decentralized blockchains and being prepared to quickly scale &amp; stratify production globally if any products become popular enough to warrant such an expansion. </p>
<p>Fungible.farm uses <a href="TRIZ.html">TRIZ</a> &quot;Theory of Inventive Problem Solving&quot; using small 'fast-fail' experiments to improve the &quot;luck surface&quot;.   Fungible.Farm is intended to operate terrestrially from Australia, but using a US/global anti-fragile business methodology to quickly commercialize biosynthetic research &amp; manufacturing.</p>
<p>Fungible's TRIZ attempts to sell &amp; commercialize, or give away (for publicity &amp; awareness) research &amp; products during or slightly ahead of the experiment.</p>
<p>This is a model similar to kick-starter and encourage community participation &amp; awareness of the progression and reward engagement more broadly in STEM including mechatronic agriculture &amp; blockchain. </p>
<p><em>Fungibility</em>: as a property, of an individual specimen or item, means it is replaceable by another identical item; mutually interchangeable.  In this case methods are designed as black-box functional 'tools' which can be built, interatively tested &amp; refined and perform continous batch or duty-cycle cultivation on Fungi.  Fungible items can be sold. </p>
<p>This organization also deals with blockchain, smart-contracts, decentralized cyber-governance which is eponymous with both &quot;fungible&quot; coins &amp; &quot;non-fungible&quot; tokens, and plans to launch a brand of SOAP known as &quot;NFTy&quot; mint crypto-coin soap.   The asynchronous chat based cyber-governance protocols are especially well suited for reinforcement learning done within a web3 sales &amp; wholesale/retail experience(s). </p>
<p>The organizational processes are intended to be super-scalar.</p>

<p>The ambitions of the project start small and get bigger in terms of proving &amp; refining tooling early on smaller &amp; less expensive projects that are each <em>intended</em> (by design) to profitable &amp; self-sustainable - but are really exercises to testing and improve the underlying systems as more layers of complexity are added progressively. </p>
<p>I see profitability as a requisite for sustainability &amp; scale.  The vision for the FF &amp; GPB system(s) is a “conservatory” indoor garden or patio farming-appliance that contains cybernetically controlled plants and weather.  The future of residential homes and commercial structures will likely contain multiple biophilic elements that exploit humans' innate desire to be part of a larger biological ‘natural’ ecosystem. These systems also clean the air, and can produce comestible food or medicinal plants such as Cannabis.  The GPB &amp; FF systems operate on terra-firma; however the 2030 &amp; beyond plan is to offer highly-reliable proven ‘astrobotany’ “Space Farming” to support the future independent Mars colonies.  Terrestrially the architectural vernacular is colloquially known as “solarpunk” which is my opinion on how humanity ought to emphasize creating a ‘sustainable’ utopian future here before we colonize other planets. </p>
<p>I am keen on continuing this pursuit as it has yielded a number of novel biotech innovations that I hope represent large multi-billion, possibly multi-trillion dollar disruptive planetary-scale market opportunities. </p>
<h2 id="background"><a class="header" href="#background">Background</a></h2>
<p>A mycologist, an evolutionary biologist, a rocket-scientist, a molecular electrochemist, an electronics engineer, and AI+robotics engineer all walk into a pub .. they have a few drinks, and together they MIGHT accidentally conceive Fungible.Farm. </p>
<p>My early Internet systems skills have helped me find/discover &amp; pursue Intellectual-obscura as an autodidiact using online resources, schools, etc. (the not-generally known physics effects, manufacturing technicals, inventions lost to time).  Intellectual-obscura is uncharacteristically easy to access now that the Internet has cataloged &quot;most&quot; of it during my lifetime, so using TRIZ I can assume that (equipped with the Internet) I have a larger &quot;intellectual toolkit&quot; available than brilliant minds of history.  By accessing the independent research from a plurality of domain specialists to identify &quot;enablement technology&quot; (enablement tech deals with feasability prerequisite(s), such that two or more i.e. #1 enablement A &amp; #2 enablement B are required - must be present to make result #3 C).   By putting each 'enabling technology' together into more complex systems, this is my contribution to evolution &amp; my own transitive humanism -- I'm not actually inventing anything, I'm using already invented/discovered things for applications the inventor/discoverer didn't see or know how to do.  So I'm using TRIZ to pragmatically &amp; incrementally explore the areas that exist between specialized research in concurrently emerging domains (areas where specialists don't frequently overlap, it's &quot;out of field&quot; for them).   Fungible is a combination of emergent tech+intellectual obscura - so looking for Entrepenurial 'high-utility' opportunities exist in-between where multiple domains are well understood for specialists (i.e. As the joke goes:  a mycologist, an evolutionary biologist, a rocket-scientist, a molecular electrochemist, an electronics engineer, and AI+robotics engineer all walk into a pub .. they have a few drinks, and together they MIGHT accidentally conceive Fungible.Farm) .. it's highly intra-disciplinary. </p>
<h2 id="finding-uncommon-knowledge"><a class="header" href="#finding-uncommon-knowledge">Finding uncommon knowledge</a></h2>
<p>But generally my projects (over the course of my entire life) all depend on knowledge that exists outside the 'common knowledge' of the zeitgeist (zeitgeist: the common knowledge &amp; meaning of ideas-words, within the generation of a modern era, as they say science progresses one funeral at a time).  TRIZ speaks to my pragmatic &amp; rationale tendencies - and is most immediately obvious and appropriate methodology for &quot;big projects, magnum opus&quot; spanning decades to contain &amp; de-risk failures, predict success within a human lifetime.   Nothing sucks more than spending a decade or more on a problem and coming up with peanuts.   SpaceX is the only company which I've seen that on some job-applications (i.e. for SpaceX Rocket Scientist) suggests knowing TRIZ is helpful, it's really only suitable for very big complex projects which have multiple areas of risk.  TRIZ is anti-helpful at the outset, because it creates a 'russian nesting doll' syndrome that bigger ideas must be unfurled as small-steps and codified into systems in a long journey.  I could compare this to learning about each types of trees &amp; organism requirements to study the forest as a system.</p>
<h2 id="background-1"><a class="header" href="#background-1">Background</a></h2>
<p>In terms of common ground, the starting point - I began my study in cybernetics, began in artifical intelligence, exploring evolutionary computing, and ultimately control systems for accelerated phytogenesis (operational characteristics of martian biospheres seemed like a good '2030 future specialization' to begin in 2014).</p>
<p>I have entirely pivoted in the past year (during covid) to mycogensis since it's a nascent field with (*i believe) significantly more beneficial impact to humanity, certainly it's got more impact &amp; utility to my 'future' martian colony biosphere project.  (I hope to live-someday &amp; ultimate die/be buried on Mars, and hopefully die peacefully in my bed, rather than from a systems failure of the biosphere I designed! 😆)</p>
<p>I am still an extreme phytology nerd -- so it is my hope that cuturally I'd be a good candidate for CEAT  .. I'm very excited about the exciting research in kingdom Plantae too!  ;-) </p>

<h1 id="australia"><a class="header" href="#australia">Australia</a></h1>
<p>Please consider a lot of this is specifically tailored to inform Australian national policy in a plurality of areas simultaneously.   It's designed as a (&quot;giant step forward&quot;), but even if it stumbles, it's designed to &quot;fall-upright&quot;, sort of like a cat, having many lives. </p>
<p>Australia is a conservative (technically laggard) nation that is presently in the discussion &amp; analysis phase of writing it's web3 crypto &quot;what is legal&quot; laws over the next few years &amp; decades.  These laws are being influenced by incumbent fintech and a few of us &quot;anon&quot; voices who don't necessarily want to see the present-day tyranny of capitalism 'waste' persist. </p>
<p>Australia is a 'academically informed' technocracy that uses scientific method (evidentiary support) &amp; data-driven decision making.   Australia operates a geographically stratified centralized federal government &amp; sovereign nation.  This process will begin entirely in the academic setting as a cooperative between several universities, and then ultimately will (hopefully) expand into government ministries as a means to educate &amp; inform policy decisions. </p>
<p>Australia is a technocracy where the academic learning institutions and the national university inform the policy-makers as part of a &quot;convo is national self interest&quot;.   Decentralized governance could have substantial benefits for a country that is geographically stratified over a massive land distance,  roughly the same size in land as the 48 US states, but with 1/12th the population &amp; 12th largest global economy ranked by GDP and a HUGE portion of that historically comes from Coal &amp; rare-earth mineral mining, and so Australia is described the UN/IPCC as a laggard with respect to climate adoption.</p>
<p>Having an 'environmentally-hostile' policy is a well deserved reputation.  It is a national embarasment for an otherwise highly progressive western society.  It sufficiently embarassed sufficient voters in the last election (about two weeks ago) to overwhemlingly declared national support for green-investments, by electing pro-environment government including several green members who now eager &amp; must move quickly to implement green-technology before they are replaced by the conservatives again (who will then attempt try to undo everything, except decentralized crypto-organizations which are prone to do good, can be difficult to dismantle).  Fungible.farm deals with sequestering carbon into both aerospace grade &quot;biopolymer&quot; construction materials, e-fashion and meat replacements.  (same atomic structure 'chitin' synthetized into different forms using electrochemistry). During the process any Co2 produced is captured and turned into SOAP which I hope to sell at/with/through national retailers for visibility. </p>
<h1 id="australia-1"><a class="header" href="#australia-1">Australia</a></h1>
<p>Australia has more potential reasons to benefit from early-adoption of decentralized self-governance of non-custodial (ERC-4626 multi-factor multi-custodial signatory) can obviate many of the forms of 'dodgy' custodial financial malfesiance, reduce risk of accidental compromise of a single bad actor, or well placed hacker attack using smshing, etc.   Despite this upcoming Australian laws are likely to require entirely centralized custodial controls (*through the error of omission). </p>
<p>Australian citizens, totalling only 24 million already enjoy progressive ideas such as socialized healthcare, ranked-choice 100%-mandatory voting in all federal elections, etc. and so the cybesecurity posture is being designed with the GOAL of someday providing a proof of concept for 'high-security paranoid cybersec' for self governance, but to illustrate how this mechanism can be used to *potentially do future national federal elections, and may attempt to increase adoption for more advanced conceptual ideas within the country but put together in a package that has aspects that nearly every non-technophobic Australian should support.  The nation is extremely agriculture prone, and also relies heavily on guidance from it's centralized federal bueracracy &quot;nanny state&quot;, so nothing happens here without the government being involved - it's quite difficult to introduce new ideas, so I must do this through the schools (that is the defacto mechanism for introducing new ideas, as a PhD candidate with one or more supervisors).  I'm also pushing for non-Australian e-citizenship for companies or persons who want to participate, but initially this is a national project I am presenting to the federal government to inform it's web3.0 strategy (what I call web2d0t99~) .. as a bridge to future web3.0, then web3d0t1 web3d0t11 web3d0t11~ repeating as a path to industry 4.0,  transacting business using smart-contracts with national retailers, and basically listing which organizations &amp; banks, insurance companies declined to work with us because they couldn't &quot;technically&quot; keep up (public identification &amp; shaming of technology laggards as a method of last-resort).   Activist investors can then use this information as one criteria to decide which companies they wish to invest &amp; engage with. </p>
<p>(NOTE: industry 4.0 which is a term for robotic process automation, that fungible.farm uses, 'dark factory' run by mechantronic cultivation, since humans are a source of contamination for mushrooms, industry 4.0 approach is better optimum approach for cultivation).  Australia has a labor shortage and high labor costs, so robotic cultivation in agriculture, and in this case 'indoor vertical farming' is especially useful since it would allow approximately presently-zoned 427 million hectares of land to be farmed vertically, producing enough food, material &amp; energy by (itself) to fulfill the needs of several earth sized planets -- hopefully approaching encouraging Earth to surpass the Kardashev level 1 boundary in less than a century.</p>
<p>Australia presently enjoys high crypto-currency as a speculative commodity 'investment' among its citizens, but MOST Australian crypto-adopters presently leave money in exchanges.  Australians like to invest in Australin enterprises, and they have national green 'retirement' super-annuation focused funds that are not crypto-savvy and can't be crypto-savvy until such governance mechanisms are vetted &amp; approved by the bueracracy (which itself operates as an academically informed technocracy).</p>
<h1 id="structural-ultracapacitors"><a class="header" href="#structural-ultracapacitors">Structural Ultracapacitors</a></h1>
<p>Here is the short 'why' you should be excited about this for Australia --  more than 90% of present day semi-conductors are made in Taiwan.  Each nation is presently assessing their on dependency in a complex geopolitical world - how to become self-sustainable in semi-conductor manufacturing.   The present day belief is that is assumed to costs billions of dollars to build complex &quot;manufacturing plants&quot; (also called 'nodes' in a semiconductor system design venacular), but has no other overlap to agriculture that I'm aware of.   Presently the only place in Australia I'm aware of that does any type of semiconductive fab is in Adelaide, as a semi-secret CSIRO project to nationally make &quot;TPM' chip's&quot; for defensive military &amp; possibly critical infrastructure applications.   However I am quite sure if CEAT was to approach CSIRO with the simple idea of growing transistive mushrooms for incorporation in cybernetic systems, they may identify many applications. 
To be clear, my proposed applications are microscale 'durable lightweight solid state biological energy storage' not-necessarily suitable for nanoscale high frequency fabrication (CPU's, etc.), but certainly a flexible, durable TPM chip is conceivable by the end of the decade or possibly much sooner. </p>

<p>Lunar Agrinomy</p>
<p>Dear Dr. Volker Hessel,</p>
<p>I wanted to thank you for the time you spent with me over the holidays.  I reviewed our conversation which I enjoyed greatly.  Thank you for your time. </p>
<p>Upon consideration of your project related to future lunar agronomics I attempted to modify my own desire to pursue Martian agriculture.</p>
<p>The broad common areas:
Similar requirements for closed-biospheres &amp; sustainable tech
Space Transport is cost prohibitive, lightweight durably shielded equipment
Absence of petroleum, bacteria, etc. suggest the need to redesign nearly all existing earth manufacturing processes </p>
<p>It was quite enjoyable to review a variety of papers &amp; conclusions derived principally from the Apollo era missions that covered the composition &amp; stratification of the lunar regolith and more recently confirmed by ESA, blabla. </p>
<p>The present assumptions about lunar regolith seem straightforward &amp; comprehensively studied.   The lack of water &amp; atmosphere presents itself to me as the largest obstacle towards lunar occupation with self-sufficiency (not reliant on earth) will require some amount of agriculture. </p>
<p>The relative simplicity of lunar vs martian missions can be staged with considerably shorter timeframes and the moon maintains a consistent distance and synchronous rotational orientation with respect to earth.  A small moon colony &amp; research outpost could be indefinitely supplied from earth with sufficient budget &amp; resources.</p>
<p>Several feasible mechanisms exist to harvest both hydrogen &amp; oxygen from lunar strata and combine those to generate water.   Ultimately the size of a lunar colony will be limited only by the sponsoring nations ability to either continuously resupply or to pursue self-sufficiency in one or more of the requisite dimensions to support life and eliminate the requirement for ongoing resupply. </p>
<p>In terms of a lunar biosphere, related to long term occupation the size of the biosphere will require considerations including ability to operate safely under positive pressure and provide a vapor/lock moisture barrier.  Withstanding extreme temperatures, blabla.  In this capacity the ability to harvest solar radiation is simplified, and the potential to utilize lunar materials in proportion to demand. </p>
<p>The lunar absence of gravity &amp; atmosphere may present a variety of challenges related to manufacturing processes but it’s also possible that these disadvantages could be leveraged as strengths.</p>

<p>I believe that present NASA plans presume a 100% earth-origin base rather than utilize any materials for lunar construction.   Your project to produce lunar-fertilizer therefore is sufficiently ambitious.   I suspect future plans might include intentionally directing asteroids into a collision on the lunar surface as a means to enrich the lunar regolith for either mining or agricultural purposes.<br />
Potassium isotopic composition of the Moon
https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S001670372030274X</p>
<p>The Apollo era used a variety of old-tech to examine lunar soils and extract minerals.
The composition of lunar soil in particular to separate the phosphorus may be simplified  (accelerated &amp; performed with less energy) using sonotrodes tuned to the internal resonant frequency of the regolith.   The near absence of gravity suggests that terrestrial processes such as flocculation will be less effective or take considerably longer to accomplish.</p>
<p>I remain convinced that in the last few years it has become feasible to genetically engineer and cultivate DNA from organisms which are specifically engineered to utilize the high-alkaline lunar soil.   Whatever methods you are presently developing, the synthetic biotechnology approach methods will (in my opinion) demonstrate the most cost-effective mechanism for large scale ‘lunar sustanable’ biosphere construction.</p>

https://ceat.org.au/
</code></pre>
<p>I originally reached out to CEAT as my first point of contact, their inclination to participate in a research project I've been developing for principally for the past 2.5 years, as part of ~7yr continously ongoing autodidact self-paced study principally in &amp; surrounding the field of Cybernetics (at least by my estimation).   I am looking for a 'best fit' base of operations such as ANU which will provide the 'largest luck' surface to conduct my research &amp; ensure it gets appropriate visibility &amp; impact federally is closer to the action. </p>
<p>So I am attempting to find my way through the proper channels in Australia, having recently expatriated from the US trying to find my way down-under.  I can only imagine your experience travelling to the US from this land.  Covid has made networking &amp; getting meetings a bit challenging and I have found the amount of rules in Australia extremely tedious (comparatively to the US).  All roads point to the easy path being &quot;I need to find a way to align &amp; collaborate with ANU&quot; and I think your program would be unequivocally the best fit for my background &amp; project @ ANU.  I hope you agree.  💖🍄</p>
<p>This is the what/where/why I want to work with CEAT, ARC, CSIRO, etc.   at least in Australia, these organizations are really the ONLY suitable option -- unless I care to continue prototyping in my garage.   (For what it's worth, I'm keen on matriculating into the AU institutions and never returning to the US.  I'd be quite happy to remain in the AU indefinitely provided I can find a place to continue my work.   In terms of funding, at some point I will need funding - that isn't immediate, however my wife would like me to get a more conventional 'day job' - probably as a fullstack dev, cloud architect, or cybersecurity expert which will distract me from what I see as very important and useful work in this field.</p>
<p>I'm also going to assume nobody there at CEAT knows much at all about semiconductor manfacturing, what is most important is that the deposition of materials must occur in-situ during myco-cultivation using robotic methods with accuraces measured initially in micrometers and ultimately perhaps in nanometers (for transitive effects, the distance and materials between two semiconductors influences the &quot;band gap&quot; or &quot;energy gap&quot; properties, dictates the properties of how electrons move through a material).  Semi-conductor fabrication uses processes called photo lithography &amp; laser-trimming to control layered material deposition --  I am capable (possessing the skillset) to produce robotics that I hope will ultimately mimic these methods within biological organisms.  I do not expect CEAT to have this expertise, although I'll be surprised if CSIRO doesn't have at least a few people on staff who are more knowledgible than myself. </p>
<p>So my second obstacle to CEAT collaboration is to discuss/explain how it is likely possible to (in the right environment) grow organisms with semiconductive properties. </p>
<p>CEAT are reproducing small mycology experiments  - often reproducing research done by others with slight modifications (i.e. my systems) for empirical 'proving' reasons (*small steps towards a bigger goal, building layers of knowledge).  These small experiments are precursors &quot;proofs&quot; to demonstrate the feasability of a bigger system-design approach.  The ultimately goal 'end result' is written in blue below.   But to explain the 'how' is more interesting. </p>
<p>I reached out to CEAT to see if there was potentially a 'better place' in Australia for me to conduct my research than my garage. 
(My garage is a mess of robotics parts &amp; biological contamination, so the answer is hopefully YES).  Many reasons the garage aren't suitable, and I'm hesitant to try and &quot;build&quot; my own wet-lab facility, both for cost &amp; time. </p>
<p>I spend most of my time finding an expert or answer in a particular field, consuming the entirety of their publications, and then (if needed) I can sometimes write/ask/pay for their time to pick their brain on how to setup novel experiments &amp; eliminate, mitigate (or constrain) the potential causes of failure.  No matter how much money I have for research, I can't buy 'time', there are no time-machines.  The cost of a ruined experiment - the set back, especially when it is attributed to my own human error or ignorance is the most frustrating setback as an independent inventor &amp; researcher.</p>
<p>Goal for CEAT collaboration -- to reduce the time &amp; energy required to create a successful [desired] outcome which is ultimately an Entrepenurial pursuit. 
I hope to have experiments work - or to at least &quot;know why they failed&quot;, so that one or more answers can be found in the first few rounds of attempts, and the effect(s) to be repeatable thereafter
(that is the goal, produce repeatable &amp; experiments that requisite to commercial &quot;Entrepeneurial&quot; viability). </p>
<p>My goal with the initial inquiry was to ascertain the domain of CEAT -  the director &amp; leadership all appear phytologically specialized in farming.<br />
I'm coming to you with mycology and biological semiconductor fabrication, it's a big chasm to cross.  I hope you can track with me. </p>
<p>CEAT internally will need to ask - is this Plantae bias an intentional &amp; desirable specialization within the broader field of agriculture?
I will not be offended by the exclusion of mycology (it's an overlooked field, full of eccentric researchers who like to walk in forests, not spend time in labs) -- and so if it's a quick &quot;No&quot; fast-fail from CEAT then that is better 👍
CEAT dismissing my project would have no reflection on my work, since I understand it may fall outside of your organizational charter.  No worries,  most people conflate Agriculture with Plantae and my heretical work crosses all sorts of domain specializations. </p>
<p>Assuming mycology is NOT a &quot;hard Nope&quot; from CEAT then I think it's important for me to explain to you the benefits of this research &amp; approach, since I realize the inclusion of my projects would almost certainly be an outlier compared to what I assume are present-day CEAT's projects.</p>
<p>Hopefully I can make the subject interesting, but it's an entirely different &quot;Queendom Fungora&quot; vs the &quot;Kingdom Plantae&quot;, both are agriculture (science of farming). 
I realize that practically speaking 99.9% of 'renewable resources' in modern economic venacular refer to the domain of phytology.<br />
Most people can be forgiven for incorrectly conflating 'agriculture &amp; farming' with 'plants'. </p>

<p>Plan to contact various types of organizations seeking Letters of Intent for a new startup “Fungible.farm” &amp; Australian BSN to help establish a valuation and credit line, obtain a piece of land and scale out of the garage. </p>
<p>I’m a new Australian expat with an extensive California Silicon Valley network and my Australian network is quite small. </p>
<p>I’m optimistically hoping to obtain written expressions of interest or letters of intent for Australian or global investment &amp; manufacturing partners before Q1 2022 to help me finance an Australian micro-farm (100 hectares) R&amp;D scale. </p>

<p>Cybernetic Systems Engineering can explore terrestrial applications of astrobotany, including mycological remediation of soil &amp; accelerating biogenesis using machine learning/data science.</p>
<p>Cybernetic systems engineering “CSE” is part of control theory envisioned in the 1940’s but was an unsuitable career during the AI winter of my youth so I followed as an observer.  Cybernetic systems are control systems for biological organisms (not skynet).  As a CSE I can build, program &amp; repair my own scientific instruments to supervise and develop robotic cultivation &amp; manufacturing of biological organisms using a stateful &amp; distributed computing cloud.</p>
<p>The &quot;why &amp; what&quot; is important and simultaneously understanding the &quot;trees&quot; is only one way to approach studying the &quot;forest&quot;. </p>
<p>But more broadly -biological control systems 'cybernetics' are perhaps the most self-sustainable &amp; scalable means for production / continous replication of organisms.</p>
<p>I was very happy to learn ASU Canberra is one of the only a handful of schools in the world that offers a cybernetics program. </p>
<p>I would say I've been studying the foundational technologies for cybernetics / biological control theory since 2014, a field at the time which was only 60 years old (cybernetics as a field was incepted in 1954 - so it's still very nascent).</p>
<p>I can demonstrate this in my past projects to establish credability if you require, but I lack traditional academic qualifications.  No time to pursue degrees, too busy learning out in the field! </p>
<p>Cybernetics involves &amp; crosses several different domains of science &amp; technology.  This project covers mycology, mechatronic cultivation, cyber-governance using blockchain, network validators &amp; smart-contracts, various types of physics simulators and several specialized domains of artifical intelligence including natural language understanding (NLU), generative 3d evolutionary algorithms that use reinforcement learning from both agent-agent &amp; agent-human interaction.</p>

<h1 id="accelerated-mycogenesis"><a class="header" href="#accelerated-mycogenesis">Accelerated MycoGenesis</a></h1>
<p>I hope to initially validate my commercial process for cultivating vegetal bio-chitin using accelerated mycogenesis in conjunction with high-voltage induced adaptogenetic responses to process e-waste.</p>
<p>My control systems themselves are capable of accelerated biogenesis &amp; mycogenesis but I believe there is presently both significantly higher commerciability &amp; opportunity for profitability &amp; sustainability using accelerated mycogenesis for waste remediation.</p>
<p>Once a refined prototype for accelerated mycogenesis is validated.</p>
<p>This aspect is unproven, whimsical.  I hope to demonstrate that commercially viable bio-chitin cultivation supported by accelerated mycogenesis can be done concurrently with flash graphene production &amp; subsequent deposition into doped bio-ceramics (as a cybernetic system).  I hope to work with AEMO to demonstrate a PoC grid-scale ‘mushroom’ bio-resistors to consume unused-stored battery energy prior to dawn of daily-PV and/or ‘extreme weather’ events to grow bio-solar panels &amp; additional structural batteries in airfoils providing an opportunity where the worse our planetary weather becomes the more energy can also be extracted from the system.  The commercial viability of such a system depends on having access to the high-voltage inductance of the national grid (not consuming energy from it) but to be commercially viable will need to be done in-series with grid transformers rather than be a standalone system (using high voltage as a temporal storage ‘sink’ when it’s useful for the grid operator or step-up facilities to do so)</p>
<p>I anticipate each of the systems is commercially viable due to the bioorganic 'green’ from waste inputs and ability to nationally recover minerals. The bio-acceleration is optional, but seems a good use for excess PV energy for post-peak unused renewable energy enroute to hydrolysis or flash-graphene production which can additionally utilize &amp; buy off-peak green-power capacity. </p>

<ul>
<li>Mushrooms &amp; Fungi do NOT require phosphorous</li>
</ul>
<p>Mycorrhizal fungi have the ability to solubilize the phosphorus present in fixed form, thus making it available to plants.</p>
<p>Phosphate is needed to replace the phosphorus that plants remove from the soil, and its annual demand is rising nearly twice as fast as the growth of the human population.</p>
<p>Elemental phosphorus exists in two major forms, white phosphorus and red phosphorus, but because it is highly reactive, phosphorus is never found as a free element on Earth. It has a concentration in the Earth's crust of about one gram per kilogram (compare copper at about 0.06 grams). In minerals, phosphorus generally occurs as phosphate.</p>

Fungible.farm attempts to address this by creating manufacturing mechanisms for superior-materials which reduce society dependence on both cellulose &amp; petrolems/plastics.

<p>SolarPunk is a movement in biophilic architecture, using natural construction materials and incorporating living organisms, moving water (often for heating/cooling). </p>
<p>Fungible Farm came from GPB &quot;GrowPotBot&quot; a separate project in hydroponics &amp; control systems for future martian colonies.  The project needed a reliable (non-petroleum) source for Co2 and several options were considered prior to arriving at mushrooms/fungi, discovering Chitin and learning of it's atomic properties. </p>
<p>The research suggests that vegetable bio-chitin using additional manufacturing processes could also be useful to fabricate transparent agri-voltaics, biophilic construction materials, and wearable e-textiles (colloquially “conductively doped mushroom leather”).  All of these are imho ‘better than plastics &amp; cellulose’ in nearly every measurable dimension - except commercial availability.</p>
<p>The FF &amp; GPB are synergistic systems that work together to perform accelerated biogenesis “Krebs Cycle” facilitated by hydroponic sensors in an indoor/sheltered growing environment that can outperform outdoor farming.</p>
<p>The technology is designed to be “sold in Ikea” safe &amp; end-user friendly and includes a variety of observable sensors &amp; wifi.   Using the cloud multiple systems can collaboratively perform multi-variant phenomic testing of growth factors such as temperature, fluence-rate, nutrient density, airflow, and other factors such as ‘intentional hormesis’ which allow life to be observed &amp; modelled as a system of electrochemically induced inputs &amp; outputs for yield optimization (larger, faster harvests). </p>
<p>I hope to demonstrate a 100% sustainable “mars-colonization” scalable-manufacturing that can be replicated using only sunlight and limited water.   Please note, in all cases these are not technologies I developed, rather these were developed and academically reported but never commercialized -- frequently due to a lower cost, less sustainable alternative being available. </p>

<p>The global demand for robotics will likely explode soon, well beyond current industrial applications &amp; home vacuums.</p>
<p>These processes proposed by FF will hopefully obsolete Li chemical batteries &amp; exoskeletons due to the structural nature of the shape, zero weight batteries have applications in aerospace, marine, farm and transportation delivery vehicles. </p>
<p>I can only presume that there will be sufficient consumer demand for electric vehicles and robotics with integrated bioorganic exoskeletons, wings &amp; structural batteries ‘at any cost’ due to their strength to weight advantages over materials such as aluminum.

<p>Approximately 1.5 billion years ago the Queendom Fungora emerged, and enjoyed unchallenged evolutionary domainace for ~300 million years prior to Plantae, eventually dinosaurs, around 50,000 years ago early humans. Despite this very few if any aspect of modern society leverage these capabilities and largely prefer cellulose which lacking the dilectrical capabilities is unsuitable for the proposed application.  Presently petroleum &amp; plastics principally provides the modern analogues that we hope to replace with mechatronic cultivation of fungi &amp; mushrooms as a means to challenge the cellulose renewable economies and provide a furtherer and more disruptive effect to societal dependence on petroleum.  This is structured as a self-funded impact investment (additional investments accelerate the plans, but are not explicitly necessary).  The non-petroleum method is always preferred to test the system on earth before <em>someday</em> <em>hopefully</em> shipping one or more of the systems to Mars to produce materials suitable for a martian biosphere &amp; interplanetary research organization.  For this reason the system is designed from a very 'first-principal' high-utility, extreme-durability, entirely open-source equipment &amp; systems fabrication approach without petroleum, coal (or with petroleum bio-fuel analogs) as an input. </p>

<p>I hope to commence large scale vegetable bio-chitin cultivation &amp; robotic manufacturing, failing that I will likely resort to natural processes that have been operational for the last ~420 million years. I hope to combine the bio-chitin with other constituents such as/including bioengineered enzymes, thin aerogels &amp; variously doped conductive layers, to create a variety of useful biopolymers with embedded transistors (bio-sensors) with materials which are principally obtained from waste outputs such as household waste, electronics, or alternative mining tailings. </p>
<p>Today the global market for bio-chitin is zero and the marine-chitin global market is &lt; $100m USD globally (made from waste marine arthropod shells using hydrochloric acid).</p>
<p>These are all harmful methods &amp; practices I hope to obviate asap, since they are unsustainable and global demand for marine-chitin would be bad for marine life on a planetary scale and my goal is to “do no harm” with the systems I develop. </p>

<p>In the past year I have become enamored with sustainable manufacturing processes incorporating lightweight (chitin-based) biopolymers with layered manufacturing to create integrated sensors, electrodes, or other ‘bio-mechatronics’ -- for use in combination with other doped substrates such as laser etched graphene or silicon.  Chitin is similar to keratin and is a 100% renewable alternative to cellulose. Chitin is naturally white or transparent, water impermeable, highly elastic, insulative &amp; fire-resistant building material.  Chitin is well suited for a variety of applications such as replacing bakelite/plastics in PCB’s or binding cellulose or other nano-textiles (similar to epoxy resin) creating “smart fabrics”.  My specific application of interest is developing structural batteries using layered manufacturing with carbon &amp; graphene-based deposition (technically: structural ultra-capacitors that don’t degrade like batteries).</p>
<p>Chitin, the etymology of the word means “shell”, the material made up of highly stable N-acetylglucosamine glucose bonds that are well suited for a plurality of applications such as aerospace.  Chitin possesses properties that are 6x stronger than steel, 2x stronger than aluminum in strength to weight ratios comparisons.  Chitin is well-positioned for lightweight robotic exoskeletons with material properties identical to those found on its namesake arthropods (crabs, mollusks, etc.).   Chitin (or water-soluble chitosan) is commercially available from a limited number of companies using principally marine waste (stinky crab shells) and is apparently universally processed with environmentally disruptive hydrochloric acid making it suitable for my sustainability goals.  Chitin can also be harvested from vetegal (mushroom) sources using a less popular enzymatic process known as ‘snailase’ which is not considered a ‘commercially viable’ alternative to hydrochloric acid. </p>
<p>To facilitate this project above I am presently working on an apparatus to robotically extract the gastrointestinal juices of slugs which are enzymatically rather than using hydrochloric acid.  Keep in mind you can cut a snail in half and it will become two snails so this model is very sustainable.</p>
<p>So for the Fungible.Farm hypothesis - is roughly, if evolution can make an electric eel, and Alessandro Volta can study that eel in 1800, and create a voltaic pile (battery), then I'm 'pretty sure' with my access to the Internet &amp; my own ability to build/fabricate technology I can 3d print an electrically capactive mushroom.  I can do this because mushrooms are made of myco-chitin which is a  dilectric (a dilectric means it's an electrically 'insulative' material, not resistive, chitin, like ceramic does not allow electrons to pass, ergo either silicon, graphene or other atomically conductive materials could use the chitin as a substrate if a suitable deposition method such as additive deposition [3d printing] or other method such as photolithography can be identified).   The Fungible.Farm goal is to grow (produce) and subsequently test many different mycochitin substrates &amp; deposition methods as part of a TRIZ methodology hopefully in conjuction with CEAT.</p>
<p>My intuition says the next hurdle I will need to overcome is to explain &quot;what&quot; I intend to farm, broadly, this is components of future cybernetic systems, I summarize this by saying &quot;robotic exoskeletons&quot;.<br />
While this seems outlandish at first glance, insect &amp; marine shrimp, crab, mollusk exoskeletons, beetle &amp; lobster claws are also made of chitin (marine-chitin or bio-chitin, vs. myco-chitin) - they are lightweight, elastic (flexible), and very strong.  The word 'chitin' means crab [shell] in ancient greek.  I am not using the marine sources of chitin because I do not believe it is appropriate to build cybernetic systems that farm animals or insect shells for entirely ethical reasons.  Presently myco-chitin is not commercially cultivated - the global market is $0 and in my case, the cultivation is a critical part of the experimentation, since the conductive substrates must be fabricated (additively deposited, 3d printed) in-situ during cultivation - many ways to &quot;skin the cat&quot;, except I don't want cat-skins -- so this is &quot;many ways to impregnate the fungi&quot; </p>
<p>Now surficially I'm hoping to do similar types of experiments &amp; outcomes as that project - &quot;same-same but different&quot; except within the queendom fungora, so the methods are similar but will produce different outcomes. 
And instead of growing furniture (as that article suggests), I am hoping to &quot;grow&quot; structural ultracapacitors by producing lightweight, high tensile dilectric myco-chitin based materials with semi-conductive properties, allowing for electrically transistive field effects (this will be done using methods commonly used in 3d printing) - these should produce shaped 'batteries' suitable for applications as aerospace jet-rocket fins, vehicle airfoils &amp; marine hydrofoils (as potential straightforward examples). </p>

<p>The broadest goal of the project is to produce multiple methods &amp; mechanisms using fungi to innovatively demonstrate &amp; sell manufacturing prototypes based by combining prior research across many specialized domains. </p>
<p>When considering the applications, I encourage you to read this publication from MIT related to cultured lab-grown wood:

<p>The fungal analog to cellulose ligands is chitin, which is the principal material which will be studied for manufacturing by fungible.farm.  Fungible.farm will incorporate cellulose ligands when it is appropriate, we're pro-fungi not anti-cellulose (in fact, fungi chemically consumes cellulose ligands during it's mycellial growth stage). </p>
<p>Fungible.farm will emphasize concurrent &quot;fast-fail&quot; to develop small but highly reliable+scalable manafacturing prototype methods.<br />
Each method has one or more commericially viabile outputs to &quot;keep machines running&quot; (such as Co2 SOAP <em>the cleaning kind</em>, a consumable consumer surfcant) these 'low tech' manufacturing are used to design/test the robotic systems &amp; software.   mint-scented SOAP called &quot;NFTy&quot; SOAP pragmatically funds &amp; symbollically contributes toward long term Co2 sequestration.  Future examples include create durable wearable electronics &amp; bio-sensors (as examples).  For this reason Fungible.farm is intended to operate as a profit-for-scalability research &amp; development organization, and aspirationally to provide &quot;Spore funding&quot; to other future projects related to trans-humanism &amp; solar-punk biophilic construction &amp; architecture.

<p>The &quot;Co2 into SOAP&quot; idea was inspired by:
https://cleano2.ca/</p>
<p>I hope to repurpose the resulting (captured) CO2 from the mycogenesis to accelerate biogenesis of comestible &amp; medicinal cultivars and demonstrate viability of zero water-loss farming structures to support one or more future colonies anywhere in Australia, globally, or eventually Mars biospheres.</p>
<p>There are many other useful emerging applications for carbon sequestration, in my case hemp cellulose can be used with flash-graphene to create safe &amp; high efficiency solid state batteries so that’s my target output. </p>
<p>Fungible.Farm came about during research attempting to discover a non-petroleum source of Co2 to accelerate biogensesis in angiosperms during increased periods of light-fluence.  Most plants are lazy and only use 1% of the sunlight. </p>
<p>There may be some questions about how much co2 sequestration can be performed with this project given the relative small size of a mushroom.</p>
<p>Growing that one pound of mushrooms is so efficient, in fact, that it generates just 0.7 pounds of CO2 equivalents.</p>
<p>https://www.mushroomcouncil.com/mushroom-sustainability-story/</p>
<p>The study finds 'conventional' production of a pound of mushrooms requires only 1.8 gallons of water and 1.0 kilowatt hours of energy, and generates only .7 pounds of CO2 equivalent emissions. In addition, the annual average yield of mushrooms is 7.1 pounds per square foot – meaning up to 1 million pounds of mushrooms can be produced on just one acre.</p>
<p>Nobody starts at scale, first we built small prototypes, but then we get bigger.</p>
<p>Let's get wrapped around the key elements, by describing the parts &amp; size.
First, this is potentially massively tall vertical farms of mushrooms, so the density could increase considerably.<br />
The airflow should <em>ideally</em> be recycled in a closed loop with an indoor hydroponic greenhouse. </p>
<p>The goal is to produce very big structures, airfoils, wings, hulls for super-tanker sized ships using large additive printers &amp; wrapped semi-conductive films &amp; biopolymers.  The composite material of myco-chitin has material properties which are stronger than carbon fiber so it's is well suited to make a variety of novel 'big things' at potentially 1/10th the present day weight (on a boat, this would translate to significantly less drag, and the chitin is hydrophobic).</p>
<p>I am hoping to obtain a &quot;clean o2&quot; unit, or obtain permission (from the founder) to replicate key pieces of the technology, or find similar technology for scrubbing co2 carbon from the air.   Ultimately I expect to be able to produce biofilms which can also do this. </p>
<p>The internal AI design system as proposed is expected to theorize &amp; design machines that perform fabrication plans for objects of any size. </p>
<p>Ultimately a single system for any scale, sort of &quot;automated shipyard&quot; except it's growing mushrooms and the containers aren't nearly as bit (at first).  And the output is Co2 SOAP &amp; coffee-reclaimed flash-Graphene 2d carbon which is conductive and can be used in recycled plastic filaments, threads, and ink.   It can also <em>potentially</em> be deposited in superconductive patterns and agents role is to find the most superconductive pattern over a series of generations, discovery by generative design &amp; analysis operated on a (nominal cost) pay-to-play virtual game-based simulation algorithms &amp; model generator is the pre-sales engine and interactivy (collaboratively human-agent) designed models. </p>

<p>The proposed mechantronic &amp; electrochemical manufacturing systems proposed are based on existing research that has been published in the last 200 years but not commercialized for this application.</p>
<p>We live in a cellulose driven renewable economy where fungi are mostly overlooked and principally hand-cultivated using limited tooling.  For this reason the business must in terms of 'potential impact' find suitable historical comparison will use the Cotton Gin (Cotton Engine) in terms of potential significance &amp; impact to society.</p>
<p>Patented by Eli Whitney in 1793 that is largely acknowledged as initiating both the industrial age of the 1800's and inadvertently being the impetus for the American civil war (since slavery could be replaced by a machine, built &amp; manufactured in the industrial north that was significantly more efficient than the methods in the religious &amp; conservative mostly agrian southern states).  The Cotton Gin automated cotton picking, and quickly spawned a variety of copy-cats devices including 'tractors' that along with modern fertilizer modernized the harvesting of cellulose crops.  ~230 years later we enjoy living in a 'cheap-cellulose' &amp; mostly-petroleum fueled economy, thanks to that invention.</p>

<p>Development of specialised bio-synthetic Hybrid additive Manufacturing methods &amp; technologies of (mostly) mushrooms &amp; FUNGI in both organic mechatronic cultivation and non-organic electrochemical synthensis/deposition.   Fungible.Farm intentionally begins with &quot;Fungi&quot; and is a 'farm' cultivation system presented as a dark factory &amp; lights-out wet-lab operated entirely by sterile robotics. </p>
<p>Hybrid additive manufacturing means layers of different materials or method/processes are used at different stages of the bigger process.  The systems to design these rely heavily on artificial intelligence &amp; simulated research to increase the number &amp; accuracy guesses resulting in a difficult to specifically quantify metric called &quot;luck surface&quot;, or ability to formulate, test &amp; demonstrate a workable manufacturing prototype &quot;solution&quot; on the first, second or equivalently early attempt (rather than the 3-5 years per invention, Fungible.farm is seen more like a R&amp;D lab equivalent to Edison or Bell labs, but run using robots, simulations and evolutionary algorithms with reinforcement learning)</p>
<p>The next part is actually much more difficult, because my project deals with bio-semiconductor fabrication, which itself is a nascent field within a highly specialized emergent field of semiconductors.  Most people who are studying electrical engineering of metamaterials end up in the quantum field effects and whatnot (and I admit, those are super interesting, but it's just not the type of research that can be done outside of academia,  and that makes it more interesting since I know I'm probably the only person with my skills pursuing this, it's unconventional because of the intra-disciplinaryness of the idea).  .. also I will point out that both mushrooms &amp; semiconductors experiments can both be contaminated &amp; damaged by the presence of bacteria from human skin shedding, before you go &quot;there is no reason to put these two ideas together&quot;, so in reality -- robotics are a prequisite to the form of mycological cultivation I'm referring.  The robotics don't need to be state of the art 5nm process, they can be 250nm and be suitable for my needs -- in many cases the 250nm version is more durable 'thicker gauge' that a 5nm version - especially where elasticity is desired). </p>
<p>We as humans until recently have lacked the tools to even study &amp; classify the amazing skills of mycological organisms, bio-engineering lichen colonies and letting the smallest micro-organisms do the 'heavy' lifting.   I hope these are the types of projects CEAT is interested in, farming with micro-organisms, genetic engineering, etc.   Anybody who is following lab-grown meats - something that less than a decade ago did not exist. 
Fungible.farm is proposing methods to farm materials that will appear in both next generation 'recyclable' iPhones, drones, solar panels, electric planes, &amp; future space ships. </p>
<p>As a 'reasonable' rule of thumb, anything semi-conductive can usually also be made transtitive (transistive: means the conductive property can be switched on and off) based on it's shape &amp; arrangement of the semi-conductive material properties (in semiconductor lingo this is called &quot;doping&quot;, but explaining this too much for now, other than additive deposition of the materials allows me to control the the shape &amp; amount of material deposition, such that I expect ultimately to demonstrate transitive properties, after I demonstrate semi-conductive properties.)   My intuition and research (and speaking with experts in these field) suggset both these conclusions are entirely valid &amp; accurate.   So the first step is to demonstrate 1. mycological  conductivity, then 2. myco-capacitiveness, then 3. myco-transitive behaviors (or to do 1, then 2&amp;3 at the same time).   There is potentially MORE diverse &amp; exotic species suitable for next-generation laboratory farms within the Eukaroytic (multi-nucleus) Queendom Fungora that are well suited for this.   Power sources could literally be DC,  inductive charging, phytovolatic, photovoltaic (such as incorporating perovskites), radio-frequency, or even radioactive or cobalt-60 gamma-ray &quot;atomic batteries&quot;.  Obviously I'm not looking to start there, but I want to illustrate the types of experiments that given a decade I intend to pursue provided my health and mind stay intact.   Also it is worth mentioning that I plan to use a combination of silicon &amp; graphene in my projects, as well as other materials incluing zeolites, lithium &amp; other salts, potentially with laser trimming and other stuff that wasn't available to Volta or Linneaus.</p>

<p>The resultant vegetal bio-chitin would then be electrochemically processed into doped bio-ceramics for use in lightweight fireproof structural (zero-weight) ultracapacitor ‘batteries’ using an additive manufacturing process with laser fusing of metals such as graphene, phosphorous, or copper deposition would produce bio-transistors for electronics &amp; sensors ideally suitable for robotic exoskeletons or wearable integrated biosynthetic e-textiles. </p>

<p>Instead of an item having a battery, the non-chemical energy-storage is inside the items non-plastic case or super-structure of the item or machine (such as a drone frame, wing/rotor, or marine hydrofoil).  The systems for producing this are done using lamination of dielectric &amp; selectively doped with 2d turbostratic carbon graphene on semiconductive biofilms which themselves (based on the deposition pattern of the ferrous or conductive material) may present novel electromagentic or photovoltaic properties (examples to follow).</p>
<p>The resulting dilectric substrates allows (for example) placement of sensors or semi-conductive material deposition onto &amp; within a dielectric material such as chitin.  Pure chitin nanofibrils are expected to have high mechanical properties, e.g. tensile strength, compared to regenerated chitin (however no such cultivation mechanism presently exists).  Present day technology uses deacetylated β-chitin nanofibrils from marine and research papers ubiquitiously cite that the deacetylation (using HCl acid) destroys the atomic substructure, for this reason Fungible.farm anticipates that our mechatronic application in-situ synthensis during mycellial formation is the 'missing component'.   Chitin is the mycellial material found in mushrooms, but most people will be familiar with marine-chitin which is crab shells (the etymology of the word chitin itself means &quot;crab [shell]&quot; in ancient greek), or insect arthropod exoskeletons (such as beetle claws)which are among the lightest &amp; strongest substances recorded (as measured by Youngs modulus).  Fungible.farm will conduct research to inform the feasability of continous-flow hybrid manufacturing of fungi derived myco-chitin materials in a 'dark-factory' (100% robotically operated wet-lab clean-room) that is dark to avoid contamination from humans &amp; decrease cost of labor. </p>
<p>I added quotes to &quot;battery&quot; because it's not technically batteries.   Alessandro Volta invented [discovered] the materials to create a voltaic pile in 1800 (the modern precusor, enabling technology for batteries), he was at the time attempting (very unsuccessfully) to deduce &amp; replicate the biological effects evolutionary biology [nature] had already mastered in an electric eel roughly ~200 million years earlier.  Volta found another way to store power, and he died never understanding how an Electric eel physiologically worked, he was 'lucky' and saw an alternating 'stack' pattern in the eel and started to try and replicate it with different metals which he already new were conductive.   Volta's accidental discovery happened because he mostly used materials which were knowing to have measurable ionic &amp; electron charge carrier properties - so he had (in TRIZ terminology) an excellent &quot;luck surface&quot; (he could make better guesses, and happened to discover a natural physics phenomeon).    Volta's discovery had profound impacts for our modern humanism - in fact the term &quot;Voltage&quot; is named after Alessandro!   I am NOT attempting to replace Volta's work, batteries &amp; voltaic piles are electro-chemical, and my search is in pursuit of lightweight solid state &amp; high tensile fabrics which can be wrapped for &quot;structural&quot; applications (these are coloquially called &quot;zero weight&quot; batteries, because the weight is structural &amp; tensile strengths exceeding aluminum &amp; carbon fiber).    The strength of chitin comes from the poly-N-acetylglucosamine hydrogen bonds that connect the polymer strands.   Depending on the alignment &amp; layering of the polymer the final composition can be rigid (like an acrylic or beetle claw) or elastic (like a high tensile fabric) but ultimately it's all same material in different orientations. 
Reference: https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.biomac.5b01653</p>
<p>So I use the term battery only to make the subject more approachable to non-electrical engineers, the proper term is &quot;ultra-capacitance&quot;, there is no electro-chemical reaction.   To finish my narrative - the electric eel incidentally was originally 'discovered' and cataloged ONLY 30 years prior to Volta, his discovery was facilitatied by his own curiousity and studying the earlier work of Carl Linneaus.   Linneaus who is historically attributed with cataloging &amp; introducing the 5 'kingdoms'  (animal, plant, fungi, protist and monera), as well as ALL the latin naming conventions for everything we use today. Volta was reading his work, that lead to the development of voltaic piles, the precursor to batteries.  Unfortunately, shortly thereafter science became much more specialized - electronics engineering and biology diverged as separate fields, resulting in separate disciplines of specialization - so it is unlikely anybody has actually tried to do this, certainly with the enabling technologies I have access to, on paper - a TRIZ analysis suggests this is certainly feasible, but simply overlooked in favor of mostly rare-earth mined metals being used in batteries when there is actually little-to-no explicit physical-law requirements, it's all material science.  (In fact solid state batteries are better in many aspects, especially naturally producing buoyant thermally insultative 'fireproof' structural energy storage devices, have so many applications its difficult to fathom!).</p>
<hr />
<p>Background information</p>
<p>This document contains notes on developing a construction material / technique that describes large solid-state supercapacitors “rechargeable battery” designs suitable for new-construction integration with PV-solar or wind generated renewable power buildings.   In layman's terms: brick batteries. </p>
<p>The Australian construction market relies heavily on bricks, along steel (iron), and the economy has rich deposits of coal (which is mostly pure carbon).  These are primary chemical ingredients for tertiary cell “rechargeable batteries” using ultra-capacitors.  Ultra-capacitors can be made out of a variety of materials (such as bricks) by incorporating small amounts of doping agents during sintering within bricks.  The bricks would retain their full durability for construction but also be able to serve a dual purpose as a home or commercial energy storage reservoir.  A large portion of this business proposal hinges upon cultivating a partnership with one of the 67 brick manufacturers within Australia.  Several of the companies are publicly traded regional and Asian construction supply conglomerates. </p>
<p>Why Australia
Australia is a unique continent and country of limited population and blessed with an abundance of natural resources spread across a huge area.  Australia due to its geographic location benefits from a high degree of self-sufficiency. Due to its small population and highly educated workforce (and trade-schools) it has a cozy relationship between science and industry that is unparalleled in the world.   Australia's government and scientific bureau CISRO are both forward thinking toward climate change which threatens many of Australia's cities and natural habitats.   Australian manufacturers operate across geographically diverse regionalized communities are able to more easily leverage word of mouth and can therefore adopt (or adapt) innovative technologies that suit their needs.  With an abundance of sunlight Australia is leading the world in photovoltaic (PV) energy and is even in the process of exporting that energy to Singapore via a superconductive underwater cable. Energy independence is recognized as a national imperative mission by all Australians but especially among Australia industrialists. </p>
<p>Inspiration: Turn normal Red Bricks into Electric Storing Supercapacitors
The inspiration for this paper came from:
https://science.slashdot.org/story/20/08/12/188249/scientists-turn-normal-red-bricks-into-electricity-storing-supercapacitors
The inspiration article above started my line of inquiry -- at first glance it’s innovative, well written and thoroughly researched -- but upon deeper inspection it embodies the worst of academicia.  The resulting PEDOT coated bricks lack any real world suitability for industrial purposes. The process described required a secondary processing of the bricks for 14 hours performing vapor deposition of a P-EDOT water impermiable layer and infusing the bricks with sulphuric acid (likely rendering them unsuitable).  While reading the paper, a better idea presented itself.  The idea of arranging doped bricks in a super-capacitive design came from another article I read months ago about graphite doped “self healing” conductive concrete. </p>
<p>What are SuperCapacitors: The “Tertiary” (3rd Generation) battery</p>
<p>Reference: “IEEE: Scientists are confusing batteries and superconductors argue experts” https://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-talk/green-tech/fuel-cells/scientists-are-confusing-batteries-and-supercapacitors-argue-experts</p>
<p>Supercapacitors (and Ultracapacitors) are technically not batteries att all, although perhaps this distinction only applies to scientists. Batteries built over the past 200 years have accepted designations as primary (electrochemical, single use - disposable) and secondary electrolytic (rechargeable, of any chemical composition).   Currently 90% of the world's batteries are primary (disposable) while secondary (2nd generation) “rechargeable” batteries are growing mostly due to portable electronics and more recently electric cars.  High density secondary (non-disposable) batteries are almost universally constructed from a variety of rare-earth materials such as lithium that is often sourced in conflict regions.  In the future sustainable batteries will likely be made from graphene which has superior properties (although graphene was theorized in 1859 it wasn’t synthesized until 2004). Incorporating graphene as a substitute for coal is discussed later both coal and graphene are pure carbon in different molecular configurations. </p>
<p>Super-capacitors aren’t (by scientific definition) “batteries” at all but are in fact solid-state ‘static’ charge circuits.  Unlike secondary batteries supercapacitors can be quickly cycled (“charged and discharged”) repeatedly without wear and tear, providing far-superior energy storage to secondary batteries - hence “tertiary” (3rd generation) batteries.   Second generation batteries suffer to varying degrees to an effect called polarization which increases their resistance to charge after each use, and while they have higher energy density than super-capacitors there will typically need replacement after a limited number of duty-cycles - with the best batteries being able to withstand 10,000 cycles (27 years @ 1 cycle per day), whereas tertiary batteries designs based on super-capacitors can withstand millions or billions of cycles (2,700 to 2.7 million years @ 1 cycle per day).   Super-capacitors are finding all sorts of interesting applications such as regenerative braking on electric cars.  A 2020 report by Allied Market Research valued the global supercapacitor market at a modest $3.27 billion in 2019, but predicted that would reach $16.95 billion in 2027—a five-fold increase in just a few years!</p>
<p>History of Batteries, Capacitors &amp; SuperCapacitors:
Although Greek &amp; Iraqi museums claim to have discovered batteries in antiquity it was not until Luigi Galvani (credited with the “Galvanic cell” aka “Battery”) along with Alessandro Volta (known for the “Volt” measurement) published in 1791 that certain fluids would generate a continuous flow of electrical power due to a one-way redox electrochemical process that the battery came to exist.   The primary battery would be continuously improved by a variety of well-known industrialists such seeking to increase charge and eventually make a reusable electrochemical (secondary) battery. </p>
<p>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_layer_(surface_science)</p>
<p>The electrolytic capacitor was first invented in 1957, along with a variety of other capacitors being invented in subsequent years along with the rise in digital circuits.  The first supercapacitor was invented in 1982 but was limited to military research applications due to cost and secrecy.  The origin of “super-capacitor” was patented by NASA in 1995 and the term was used publicly around 1999.  Super-capacitors remain one of the most popular areas of undergraduate work in material science today (see “inspiration: supercapacitive bricks”).  Several manufacturers including Tesla, Apple and Samsung are currently investigating manufacturing their own super capacitors to replace (or supplement) lithium-ion batteries in their cell phones however the material-science &amp; manufacturing.  The super-capacitor is logically the “tertiary (3rd generation) battery” with distinctive characteristics.  There is a lot of work being put into lightweight batteries at the present but very little work being put into heavy batteries (since conventional batteries are generally already very heavy) - at least beyond the story cited in the origin. </p>
<p>Hybrid Construction
The properties of a super-capacitor</p>
<p>Tertiary Batteries - Second Generation: Flash Graphene
While the initial design proposals will use pulverized coal (or coke) as a source of carbon long term R&amp;D consideration should be given to flash-graphene as a future improvement to this design.  Recent studies have indicated that ‘flash graphene’ can be inexpensively produced and could also be incorporated, however no large scale manufacturing technology has been developed.  Flash graphene can be sourced from any type of carbon including hemp cellulose waste or even non-recyclable plastic trash.   Due to a lack of availability in flash-graphene pulverized coal as a carbon source.  Graphene has a higher energy density as compared to lithium-ion batteries. Where the lithium is known to store up to 180 Wh per kilogram, graphene's capable of storing up to 1,000 Wh per kilogram. So, you can have a higher capacity graphene battery pack of the same size as the lithium-ion battery</p>
<p>Lithium-ion has a higher energy density at 150/200 Wh/kg versus lithium iron phosphate at 90/120 Wh/kg. ... On the other hand, the discharge rate for lithium iron phosphate outmatches lithium-ion.  It is believed that graphene iron phosphate will exhibit similar characteristics. </p>
<p>Graphene is simply a single layer of carbon atoms and there are few (if any) industrial manufacturing techniques (although a huge amount of research).  Developing the doping process and fabrication with ground coal will allow for early market validation - and future higher density can be achieved using graphene.   There are also a variety of papers which demonstrate using graphene doping in concrete facilitates self healing and higher strength-to-weight ratios (as much as 10x) reducing the need (*and cost) for reinforcing steel and it is anticipated that similar achievements may be possible within the brick industry. </p>
<p>An electrode in an electrochemical cell is referred to as either an anode or a cathode (words that were coined by William Whewell at Faraday's request).[1] The anode is now defined as the electrode at which electrons leave the cell and oxidation occurs (indicated by a minus symbol, &quot;−&quot;), and the cathode as the electrode at which electrons enter the cell and reduction occurs (indicated by a plus symbol, &quot;+&quot;). Each electrode may become either the anode or the cathode depending on the direction of current through the cell. A bipolar electrode is an electrode that functions as the anode of one cell and the cathode of another cell.</p>
<p>the anode is the positive (+) electrode and the cathode the negative (−) for non-batteries! (i.e. super-capacitors)</p>
<p>supercapacitors work electrostatically, rather than through reversible chemical reactions, they can theoretically be charged and discharged any number of times (specification sheets for commercial supercapacitors suggest you can cycle them perhaps a million times). </p>
<p>A cathode is the electrode from which a conventional current leaves a polarized electrical device. This definition can be recalled by using the mnemonic CCD for Cathode Current Departs. A conventional current describes the direction in which positive charges move. Electrons have a negative electrical charge, so the movement of electrons is opposite to that of the conventional current flow. Consequently, the mnemonic cathode current departs also means that electrons flow into the device's cathode from the external circuit.
The electrode through which conventional current flows the other way, into the device, is termed an anode.</p>

<p>Respectively I am working on a prototype Fungible.Farm with a 'today' strategy that is Web2d0t99~ and Web3d0t1 as my present day &amp; designing the future operational governance technical governance controls for my projects. </p>
<p>Several aspects are presently aspirational but are informed by TRIZ / TIPS method to have a larger-than-expected luck surface <em>in Australia</em> because of how the ideas will be presented to 'regular' non-web3 blockchain people where this might be their first interaction with a DAO. This is <em>especially</em> expected to be True with ministerial regulators and non-technical agri-science advisors.  Ultimately the organization is/will be funded by me and future investors are all consumers of the products placing pre-orders for allocations (which is conceptually perhaps easier to understand &amp; explain)  ... less web3.0 more kickstarter at the web2d0t99~ stage. </p>
<p>I would call this &quot;Decentralized Australian Organization&quot;, part of a broader strategy  Webd0t299~ (a joke: the step before Web 3.0). - it's not a conventional DAO and it wouldn't presume to call itself AustraliaDAO but it might <em>someday</em> aspirationally produce an open-source artificate a web3d0t1 &quot;forkable template&quot;, targeting a pluraity of future web 3.1 -- and those crypto-code artifacts will remain, even a failure of this project, a subsequent project could,  by it's nature of web3d0t1 existance, use it as a template &amp; guide (perhaps what <em>NOT</em> to do),  and this will inform national federal policy for the worlds 12th largest economy to some degree, and invent new less cellulose-is-the-only-renewable-tech &quot;mushroom&quot; cultivation CO2 sequestration, and &quot;spore&quot; [instead of seed] funded.   By targeting web 2.99 &amp; web 3.1 the goal is to land somewhere just ahead of the web3.0 space, this is a future project that will likely take 3-5 years to be fully realized. </p>
<p>The goals of Fungible.Farm are trans-humanist cryptographic blockchain smart-contracts for internal cyber-governance for several reasons summarized later and in more detail in [./crypto.md].  This method specifically seeks to avoid &amp; mitgate the most undesirable &quot;crypto-anarchy&quot; aspects of cyber-governance aligned to accentuate the postive geographic distance nullifying aspects of decentralized governance. </p>
<p>Presently Australia is mostly encouraging blockchain as decentralized ledgers with entirely centralized custodial control structures and the goal of this project is NOT to mimic or encourage that bad behavior.  The rules they are proposing are pretty bad, written by old-school non-technical fintech regulators - which will negatively impact community &amp; not-for-profit research organizations by (*for example) requiring decentralized crypto-governance organizations to be ISO27001 compliant (huge cost, and not well suited for crypto-orgs, but it is how old web2.0 banks operate and they are writing the rules, so this project is seeking an exemption).   But also - regulators can't regulate what they don't understand or know exists, and some of the policy they are proposing is really exceptionally short-sighted (both in climate tech, and crypto-blockchain governance) and web3 when applied correctly can be incredibly disruptive especially in the &quot;its here, and now you must deal with it, but in a civil &amp; polite way&quot; as a means to influence &amp; inform good policy decisions on big topics related to cross chain atomic swaps (between ETH2 L1, polygon L2, solana, using polkadot) as a poly-chain &quot;web3.1 reference implementation&quot;, and ideally Australian 'sovereign bond' backed (even if you hack it, it will fork, sort of 'voluntary safety in crypto' that Australians organizations might prefer versus the more traditional crypto-anarchy approach that is 'the norm' globally - at least I hope to make a more peaceful &amp; secure version here in Australia and the whole project is designed with optics &amp; community engagement for both children &amp; adults.  Ideas for future services might include crypto-insurance &amp; national cyber-safety guidelines, helping to develop &amp; curate things of that nature, by putting the tips inside/on the Co2 SOAP packaging &quot;NFTy soap&quot; from Fungible.Farm</p>
<p>I am presently, *in conjuction with a few others from my network &amp; cooperatives - but 'my' project,  includes research towards developing a (*potentially) human life saving, petroleum industry disruptive, mechatronic cultivation &amp; synthesization of fungi based biopolymers &amp; related agriculture manufacturing (fungible.farm).    The organization is being established to govern &amp; approve  the research objectives using web3 decentralized governance as an experiment within the academic instutions to inform policy within the technocratic federal administration.   I.e. it's producing real tangible effects .. initially by selling Co2 SOAP (the cleaning kind) but ultimately many forms of bio-polymers which are specialized, produced in a bio-friendly way, and I hope will enjoy popularity in a plurality of commercial applications.  (Mushrooms exhale Co2 during their mycellial growth stage, plants can use the Co2, or we can put it into Soap and sequester it, the plants inhale the SOAP and fungi consumes the wood as part if it's growth, ultimately the soap is washed down the drain where is it sequestered in the earth.  But making things with the lightweight myco-fabrics, myco-packaging will allow the business to scale rapidly and consume several forms of green-waste and producing everything from meat-replacing comestibles &amp; construction materials.</p>
<p>The crypto-governance aspect is a &quot;success in failure&quot; (less-wrong, anti-fragile) approach that *hopefully can only create concurrent positive impact (in success &amp; failure, more in success, but even in failure, it's negative emissions), if any products are made at all ever, it will only sequester carbon, and the machine for that is already built &amp; proven by a canadian firm who is keen to the AU market. ;-)  .. so it's mostly self-sufficient on day #1.  but the goal of fungible.farm is to bring &amp; demonstrate these types of technology into Australia and it's goal is to work across the various groups who would be interested in this type of technology, going forward.</p>
<p>Mushrooms have many applications, in waste-remediation, especially the way Fungible.farm is intentionally cultivating them.   I won't focus on that, I'll focus on the crypto-aspects since I know whoever is reading this should speak crypto. ;-) </p>
<p>Which [as proposed] will operate as an ERC1155 &amp;  ERC4626 DAO with Vault/Time &amp; Multi-Signatory Smart-Contract &quot;Lock&quot; Controls as part of what (*I aspirationally intend) will be a nationally recognized (sovereign real-estate investment trust, federal government recognized joint venture/cooperative with ANU, and assisting the AU Treasury Office, ASIC, financial crypto regulators with proof-of-concept) - that is funded (initially, nominally) by my own research endowment.    It takes longer to explain it than it will take those organizations to approve &amp; implement it. ;-)  I can't build my part until they agree to participate.</p>
<p>I am not seeking FUTRDao funds or would not be inclined to vote/recuse on such proposals if there was any interest in alignment.    But effectively it's for making more FUTRDaos in Australia as RDC's (which themselves are a unique form of investment cooperative, pre-dating Web3 by decades).  I could also suggest that Fungible.Farm be issued FUTRDao governance token(s) could be placed into the ERC4626 non-custodial wallet (vault) of fungible.farm smart contract in the future.   By crypto-standards this is all pretty 'best-practice' but that isn't how things are presently done in Australia. </p>
<p>The Fungible.farm &quot;cooperative research&quot; organization internally operates an ETH2 becaon-chain altrusitic validator (running the network's it requires to operate, a symbiotic relationship), and potentially I *aspirationally hope to be approved as an filecoin/ipfs, (also as as a secure-notary), following that helium is in an incubation stage.  Both should generate some nominal amounts of sustainable income suitable for self-writing grants &amp; scholarships.  It is &quot;profit for growth &amp; sustainability&quot;, all products made &amp; sold have some sort of beneficial outcome. I get a lot of inspiration from Dr. Bronners Soap (if you are familiar with that brand).</p>
<p>I plan to file regulatory paperwork with the AU government, &quot;Research Development Corps&quot; are a special type of 'academic governance', quasi-governement agency, and request they issue a backed by federal sovereign bond land-use lease permit, 
i.e. asking the government to recognize it's soveriegn authority to regulate the central crypto wallet, &amp; helping federal crypto-regulators understand their role(s) in custodial governance of the organization.<br />
The project takes a long view with regard to 'tooling' for operational efficiency, with the intention of producing an open-source nationally acceptable DAO organizational &quot;ASIC approved&quot; charter that are &quot;forkable&quot; with streamlined regulatory/setup &amp; auto-filing, &quot;audit us&quot; cybersecurity mechanism, and hackathons for finding bugs and building the system within schools to provide grants to both Australian and international graduates (as a way to export Australian culture globally) </p>
<p>What I am proposing with the Fungible.Farm DAO is a voluntary form of federally cooperative / 'special use permit' for cyber-governance (that probably only makes sense in Australia, but it is the worlds 12th largest economy and #1 coal usage per capita, citizens would like to decarbonize their economy but is stuck in the past, and desperately needs more &quot;future&quot; industries, this can help!)</p>
<p>The controls built into the contract assigning roles as the national univerities &amp; eventual federal level policy makers to inform them on web3 governance.  as a means to mostly let the technocracy see how one of these organizations might work &amp; produce useful cyber-governance artifacts (forkable code repositories) for the national federal technocracy, but funded by selling SOAP and Mushroom biopolymers made using Cybernetics to Australians through the national university.</p>
<p>The mint SOAP + NFT is a gift (i.e. it's something inexpensive we can give away as gifts as a tangible reminder - swag, that is useful), it's a mostly carbon, you wash with it, it sequesters carbon <em>hopefully</em> from coal plants and at least from my Co2 generating mushroom farm.  and so it aligns with the clean &amp; &quot;green&quot; messaging, blabla.  it's easy path to onboard, introduce NFT's, etc.   but all very Australian dialogue &amp; policy centric.  so a lot of the technical aspects will be obscured for those who don't care and just want to buy the products, at least on a wholesale level, will need to use crypto and issue crypto-purchase orders, smart-contracts, etc..  (i.e. I'm planning to manage all the vendors using smart-contracts and if they don't want to sell my products I will go directly to consumers &amp; small independent grocers) .. so it's green consumerism, and it's presented as a federal research project and so everybody is invited and only those who don't participate should have FOMO.</p>
<p>As established as a Research Development Corporation to demonstrate &amp; form a national (legally compliant) template for organizational non-custodial decentralized governance.  [A lot of Australian here, basically informing and influence national Australian blockchain policy &amp; adoption of everyday people].</p>
<p>Additionally there is a minor carbon sequestration project at the outset in the form of SOAP (with NFT's printed on it, sold in AU stores with cybersecurity &amp; web3 onboarding tips).  This is an organizational aspect of part of a PhD in the Cybernetics at the University of Australia)(ANU) <em>and</em> concurrent Digital Transition / Blockchain Governance at RMIT which is presently still in early review stages being presented &amp; discussed in conjunction with CEAT (Centre Entrepenurial Agri-Technology).</p>
<p>(But the purpose of CEAT is to help regulators evaluate technology on it's merits)</p>
<p>At least presently this is getting most traction by explaining how Australia needs to invest heavily in decentralized blockchain &amp; especially smart-contracts as a means to remain globally competitive &amp; self-sufficient and ultimately collaborate with other southern ocean partners such as New Zealand, etc. who I hope will be equally inclined to join the project sometime in the next decade. </p>

<p>The blockchain aspects/benefits add a plurality of benefits that <em>hopefully</em> warrant the additional complexity:
* this is envisioned as an ERC-1155 &amp; 4626 Tokenized Vault contract
* paranoid cyber-security in a decentralized cyber-governance, multi-signatory governance &amp; oversight
* simplified scalable accounting &amp; books &amp; schedules are &quot;open&quot; records, well suited to audit &amp; compliance tasks can be automated with reports and do not incur significant administrative overhead. 
* non-custodial smart-contract governed token vaults eliminate a variety of problems associated with custodial governance (constrains dodgy actors, eliminates phishing, smshing to steal company funds, etc)
* this project has an additional goal of seeking &amp; encouraging new forms of regulatory oversight &amp; governance control within the agency as a form of technocratic &amp; corporate engagement as a part of a broader trans-humanist socialization goal. 
* async chat is easy/simple interface for cognitive agents incentivization &amp; gamified reinforcement learning
* web3 ordering interface &amp; manufacturing smart-contracts is 'best interface' for such tasks
* pre-sales &amp; consumer-voting can <em>potentially</em> be performed to gauge market demand for such products and perform data-driven decision making. 
* crypto aspects providing 'gating barrier to entry' at the beginning to hopefully restrict demand (the goal isn't to be profitable for profits!, it's to perform profitable research)
* crypto aspects such as 'governance tokens' provide additional forms of liquidity &amp; fund-raising in addition to traditional banks/VC's in a fair and level playing field. 
* potential for 'generative' NFT's provide gamifaction for consumer oriented comestibles (food) or surfactants such as soap, but also NFT's could also be serial numbers for proof of ownership or position in a manufacturing queue. 
* whereas fungible substrates (such as turbostratic graphene) can be represented as commodities reserved in the decentralized ledger. 
* intended(s) to provide an example non-custodial decentralized organizational governance for research &amp; development organizations. 
* by operating blockchain network validators &amp; notary nodes can also earn more crypto and provide a sustainable well-spring of internal funding, by providing services to the network it uses in a symbiotic relationship.</p>
<p>The goals for the ERC-4626 is 'academic &amp; ministerial invitations' to participate in Web3 federal infrastructure &amp; services such as a national crypto-vault, wallet crypto-asset cybersecurity, and the goal is for fungible.farm to provide some of those services to our governance board, so they can protect the organization, but the governance board will be (ultimately) high level policy makers &amp; ministers.  Ideally setting the bar &quot;very high&quot; in setting technical controls to prevent dodgy actors from performing rug-pulls. </p>
<p>For those who are invited to join Fungible.farm (and receive governance tokens) -- those are are initially academics, then minsters, and the goal will be ultimately to let the federal government exert their sovereign authority with technical controls (in the ERC-1155 contract) by establishing a industry standard identity mechanism (i.e. an ERC20 wallet) and publish that as a sovereign regulator (initially this will be performed by a quorum of universities, who then hand over control to regulators <em>someday</em> symbolically in exchange for the government signing the tokens &amp; agreeing to bond the organization against fiduciary misconduct and it is hopeful that by having strong technical controls (as part of a national solidity #include library) that these types of organizations become more common, versus the antiquated ERC20 (even with multi-signatory custodial controls, which themselves are exceptionally uncommon in Australia due to technical complexity).  The academics inform the fungible.farm policy and the ministerial regulators will ultimately issue land-use grants, bonds &amp; legislatively review + approve 'special use' mechanisms for decentralized what in Australian would be described as (non-custodial) 'cyber-governance' model as a means to inform policy. </p>

<pre><code>    * web3.0 blockchain decentralized governance operational model
</code></pre>
<p>As one optimization I'm hoping to also use a cyber-governance model/blockchain-engine because they are just easier to do what I want with but I realize most AU people who are crypto-savvy aren't web3 savvy, but these days all the smarter coders are in web 3.0, so the best place to find talent is to be involved with web3.0.  The smart-contract isn't explicitly necessary to the experiments outlined in Fungible.farm but it is important to the overall organization 'smart-contract' that oversees the experiments, but the mechanisms selected are prone to cognitive automation (robots &amp; rpa cost less than humans). </p>
<p>So I hope you will at least be curious and allow me, on a future occasion to explain how these gamified organizational patterns encourage engagement with robots, reward positive behavior and WHY that is super important &quot;not optional&quot; in a mostly planned as a bot driven organization.   I call them &quot;svelte companies&quot; those using heavy automata to make sure it stays properly aligned with the goals set by governance and avoid goodharts law for selecting good measures.  The rest is /simply/ functionally written compositional logic codified in a language known as RUST &amp; solidity handlers that can perform tasks composed idiomatically (which mostly eliminates the needs for technical roles such as system-administrators, non-novel programmers (machine translators, interface transformers), generative industrial designers, electronic engineering &amp; material simulation and a broad class of technical toil) when the system is designed with sufficient foresight in a method using open-source tools that can be interconnected with observable messaging queues and ability to time-travel backward or in parallel to earlier/alternate decisions using models under version-control precision &quot;ML/ops&quot; which being from Australia.  I'm guessing even at ANU there are probably very few who have any idea how to do these types of things with version control tools, and even fewer with 30+ years of open-source dev/ops emerging tech intuition &amp; hacker-skills crypto-coin as reward incentive system is better suited to observe and measure agent alignment &amp; success/failure when the measure is simply the pass/fail of acceptance.  I hope this passes the sniff test from a not-exactly but-close enough G/AI perspective.  I hope this explains that the project, it is internally very much an AI NLU governance &amp; operations project.  (This is the only way I'll ever build a company only if I can ensure I need to ultimately employ the fewest number of people possible since humans are the biggest source of contamination, all the processes are designed as continuous flow using vertical 'self stackable' colonies transported by overhead rail) make of compressed bricks of sawdust and other substrates (for doping) and testing, concurrent evolutionary DNA in a simulator and then in IRL.  Humans are only going to contaminate the experiments so the goal is to have a 100% observable system with digital twins objects and highly deterministic (&quot;model friendly&quot;) behaviors. During my diligence, I saw your Cybernetics program and now that I realize <em>who</em> you are, I'm just going to sort of overshare a lot of the detail with regard to my project &amp; background and sincerely ask for you to review my work, my approach, any feedback &amp; guidance/inclusion in the Cybernetics Program would be appreciated.  So this is my introductory letter, applying for a position in a future cohort and equally keen to work together upon meeting me or reading this.  Thank you again for your time. </p>
<p>The internal organization has enough moving parts that planning to be crypto-native earlier,

<p>Fungible.Farm hopes to operate as a distributed autonomous organization with non-custodial machine-agent cyber-governance controls assigned to a technocratic sovereign-national authority.  Giving one or more sovereign nation academic bodies &amp; financial regulators keys to perform data-control protocols &amp; procedures that govern critical aspects of the cyber-governance.  This is a means to block fiduciary misconduct either through intentional or accidental disclosure (getting hacked) by humans as a means to ensure organizational survival. </p>
<p>The organization will use best-practice 'state-of-the-art' (for APAC) continous integration, continous development (CI/CD) producing both public and private (to the organization) data &amp; process, which voluntariliy (by smart-contract design) will cedes audit &amp; financial controls to sovereign governance &amp; parlimentary bodies as regulatory partners &amp; safe-guard control mechanisms. </p>
<p>During this research and ultimately to design &amp; sell 3d models of products &amp; services granting &quot;right to fabricate&quot; that will require web3 technology &amp; use standard ERC-20 wallets on the Ethereum L1, Polygon L2 blockchains (with an eye on multi-chain cybersecurity &amp; customer service)</p>
<p>The complexity of the systems which liberally use recently stabilized emergent technology will (hopefully) dissuade future direct copy-cats by providing a large defensible moat until the organization has achieved continous sustainability through an economy of scale.  The goal is for it to be easier to work with Fungible.farm as a partner than attempt to be a competitor in an attempt to dissuade low-utility copycats ideas from emerging and starting independently by providing a fun friendly &amp; fanatical about fungi inclusive decentralized organizational structure beginning in Australia, but spreading globally with the intention to ultimately to assist humanity in mars colonization.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="triz"><a class="header" href="#triz">TRIZ</a></h1>
<p>Fungible.farm uses TRIZ/TIPs and can be visualized as either a complex rube-goldberg machine(s) built as systems in a small-to-bigger russian nesting doll projects.  Starting inside out with some early tooling &amp; meticulous planning in preparation for a fast delivery cycle, but ultimately building systems that could deliver 'aircraft carrier' or larger marine or aerospace vehicles requires planning for scale, and refining good simulations. </p>
<p>The system &amp; approach is informed as a TRIZ/TIPs &quot;Theory of Inventive Problem Solving&quot; pattern.  TRIZ uses many small experiments (often concurrently) to build intuition and inform on the better &amp; best design approaches prior to scale.   TRIZ (pronounced &quot;trees&quot;), is a metholody originally developed for soviet era rocketry and innovation programs globally known for it's high reliability and low cost pragmatic approach.  TRIZ is suitable for breaking down big 'insurmountable' challenges into a series of black box research steps &amp; prototype designs to be validated.  Each experiment informs the final system, where it is reasonable (based on academic inferrence) that one or more experiments will produce the desired result(s).  TRIZ is known as the most successful method for &quot;invention&quot; &amp; application of discoveries rather than pure-academic doctoral research which is generally done without plans for a specific application.</p>
<p>A significant portion of my vocabulary &amp; approach relates to anti-fragile 'planning' toward identifying R&amp;D opportunities suitable for commercialization.  The method to my madness &quot;TRIZ&quot; - includes how to identify opportunities where research is likely to be profitable (therefore sustainable), &amp; how to learn from failure(s), to identify factors &amp; develop intuition of future success(es).  I come with a distinctly US task-oriented pragmatic approach, but I'm also using a non-US soviet era planning/de-risking 'toolkit' (formalized method) known as &quot;TRIZ&quot; (pronounced &quot;trees&quot;, sometimes less frequently called &quot;TIPS&quot;).   TRIZ is known in some domains (not commonly agriculture afaik) to induce superior strategic planning &amp; data-driven decision making abilities.  Regrettably TRIZ is also mostly unknown/untaught in western schools due to it's socialist origins, though it's popularity is growing in the EU - so maybe it's made it to the AU and I just don't know! (so if this explanation of TRIZ is repetitive, already known/understood then I sincerely apologize, that is very uncommon, please - skip to the blue section below if you already understand why I'm using TRIZ approach).</p>
<p>To explain TRIZ in a 'twitter sized' soundbite:  TRIZ is how the Russians were able to field a 'better' (still operational) space program for significantly-less than half of the US NASA budget! </p>
<p>(TRIZ was originally designed by/for the Soviet space program as a way to predict which outcomes would be successful, wereas .   TRIZ enjoys popularity within the field of systems engineering, anti-fragile business planning, and is especially popular within aerospace startups such as SpaceX and those attempting to mimic their capabilities.  Overwhelmingly I am the first person to mention TRIZ to all non-Rocket scientists I encounter (who are often specialists in their respective fields, whom are all smart, but aren't building rockets - which have a high cost of failure), usually those specialists are making small incremental advancements to a important but well-studied field.  TRIZ was originally developed to create &quot;new fields&quot; of science such as ballistic rocketry.  In most situations TRIZ is overkill - for most researchers - the ultimate goal is publishing small incremental papers where the principal audience is other peers 'within their field'.   I am interested in exploring the 'knowledge-gap' between those specialized fields, and also integrating intellectual obscura (roughly &quot;forgotten knowledge&quot; of humanity).  It's not quite Rocket science,  far less glamorous, but the knowledge that exists between specialized science domains that are &quot;less studied&quot; areas of the venn-diagram of modern science &amp; 'accepted' human knowledge.   I'm a US person, we are brought up to be ambitious, I don't suffer from the Australian fear of &quot;tall poppy&quot; syndrome and since I'm a self-funded researcher, fear of failure, fear of funding loss doesn't really intimidate me either - so I'm sort of an odd-ball, able to pursue research across fields that would be academic career suicide (which generally encourages specialization in a domain).   So TRIZ is my most useful tool, because it allows me to identify the factors of success &amp; failure - and to do whatever I can to mitigate the failures, but to design many small experiments as a way to validate a bigger project. </p>
